Preheat oven to 325ยบ.

Shell:
	1 3 ounce cream cheese
	1 stick butter or margarine
	1 cup flour

Cream the cream cheese, butter, and flour to make a soft dough.  Roll the dough into tiny balls.  Press one ball into a small muffin tin cup.  Set aside.

Filling:

	1 egg, beaten
	3/4 cup brown sugar (dark preferred)
	1 tablespoon butter, soft
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1/8 teaspoon salt
	2/3 cup pecans, finely chopped

Mix all the filling ingredients together and blend well.  Spoon the filling into each of the unbaked shells carefully.  This recipe is designed for 24 small shells.

Bake filled shells in a 325ยบ oven for about 25 minutes or until edges are slightly brown.
