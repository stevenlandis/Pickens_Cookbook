This makes the best pie crust.

	3 cups flour
	1 1/4 cup Crisco
	1 egg
	1 teaspoon vinegar
	1 teaspoon salt
	5 tablespoons cold water

Mix flour and Crisco well with pastry blender.  

Beat the egg, vinegar, salt, and cold water together.  Add to the flour mixture.  Mix just enough to blend.  Do not overwork the dough.

Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and place in refrigerator.  Chill well before rolling out.  

Roll out for pies between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. If the dough sticks to the paper too much, dust lightly with flour or chill and try again.
