We have tried a number of peanut butter cookie recipes, but we always return to this one.

Preheat oven to 375ยบ.

Sift:
	1/2 cup brown sugar
	1/2 cup granulated sugar

Beat until soft:
	1/2 cup butter
Add sugar gradually and blend these ingredients until creamy.  

Beat in:
	1 egg
	1 cup peanut butter
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon soda

Sift before measuring:
	1 1/2 cups flour

Add the flour to the batter and:
	1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Roll the dough into small balls (not over 1").  Place them on greased cookie sheet.  Press them flat with a fork twice in opposite directions to make an "X."  Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden.  

Transfer from cookie sheet to cooling rack.
