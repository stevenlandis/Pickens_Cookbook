Devil's Food Cake

@body
Two of my parents' best friends were Ethel and Ben Barr.  When I was little, I couldn't say Aunt Ethel and Uncle Ben, so I must have re-christened them Aunt Eccie and Uncle Bing.  They became Eccie and Bing to everyone.  Aunt Eccie's mother lived with her and Uncle Bing.  Her real name was Dosha May, but to me she was always Bammy.  It's Bammy's Wedgewood creamer and sugar bowl we have used since your dad and I were married--and it's that creamer and sugar bowl that always graced the table when we enjoyed chocolate cake from Ecc and Bing's neighbor, Mrs. Behnke.
