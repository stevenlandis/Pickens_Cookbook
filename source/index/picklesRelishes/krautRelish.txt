Kraut Relish

@body
The Hickory House, Wichita, Kansas

This adds to a relish plate, tastes good as a dip with crisp crackers, and highlights a green salad.

	1 large (2 1/2) can kraut relish or 2 pound bag
	1/2 teaspoon celery seed
	1 small can or jar red pimentos, cut in small pieces
	2/3 cup sugar
	2/3 cup vegetable oil

Mix all the ingredients together.  Simmer for 15 minutes after the mixture comes to a boil.  Seal in jars while still hot.  Serve chilled.
