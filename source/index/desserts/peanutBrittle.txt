Peanut Brittle

@body
	1 cup light Karo syrup
	2 cups sugar
	3 cups raw peanuts
	1 teaspoon baking soda

Stir Karo and sugar together in large heavy saucepan.  Add peanuts; cook 12 to 14 minutes stirring constantly when color begins to darken.  Check for hard crack by dripping drop of candy in small bowl of cold water.  When hard crack is reached, take pan off heat, stir in soda and 1 teaspoon vanilla, if desired. 
Stir and pour out on greased pan or surface.  With a spoon, lift up the candy and stretch it out to make it as thin as possible.  

Be careful because the candy is very hot and sticks to the skin.

When cool, break into pieces and package in an airtight container.
