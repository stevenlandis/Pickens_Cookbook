Chinese Almond Cookies

@body
These come close to almond cookies we buy in Chinese bakeries.

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

	2 1/2 cups sifted flour
	3/4 cup sugar
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon baking powder
	3/4 cup butter or margarine
	1 egg
	1 teaspoon almond extract
	36 whole blanched almonds
	1 egg yolk

Sift flour with sugar, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl.  Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.

Beat the egg with 2 tablespoons water and the almond extract.  Add to the flour mixture, mixing with a fork until dough leaves the sides of the bowl.

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until smooth.  Wrap in waxed paper, refrigerate 1 hour.

Form dough into 1 inch balls.  Place 3 inches apart, on an ungreased cookie sheet.  With the palm of your hand, flatten each cookie to a circle 1/4 inch thick; press an almond into the center of each cookie.  

Combine the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush on each cookie.

Bake cookies for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove to a wire rack and let cool.

Makes about 3 dozen.
