David liked this dessert so much, he even put birthday candles on it one year.

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

Crust:
	2 cups vanilla wafers, crushed
	1 stick butter or margarine
	1/2 cup sugar

Mix all the ingredients above well and spread on the bottom of a large pan, about 9 x 13 inches.  Bake in 350ยบ oven for 8 minutes.

Filling:
	1 package Dream Whip
	1/2 cup milk
	2 teaspoons vanilla
	1/2 cup milk
	1 cup powdered sugar
	1 8-ounce package of cream cheese

Whip the Dream Whip, 1/2 cup milk, and vanilla until stiff.  In another bowl, mix the other 1/2 cup milk, powdered sugar and cream cheese until creamy.  Add this mixture to the Dream Whip mixture and blend.  Pour the combined mixture into the cooled crust.  

Pour the 1 can of cherry pie filling over whipped filling in a swirling motion.  Stir slightly to distribute the cherry filling through the filling, but not to blend.  Preserve the color contrast of red and white.

Refrigerate and then serve.  Keeps well, if it isn't eaten first.  Strawberries also work.
