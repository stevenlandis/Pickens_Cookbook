White Gravy

@body
Both our mothers made copious amounts of white gravy.  It was a staple with fried chicken and chicken-fried steak that we ate each week.

After we were married and Daddy went to the Far East, I finished a semester of grad school and returned to Wichita to keep house for your Granddaddy with the Moustache for the summer.  One of my Andale cousins returned with me for a few days after I'd had one of my "cooking" visits.

Kit Hein was a couple of years older than I, but not much more experienced in the kitchen.  Both of us knew how to fry chicken which your grandfather loved.  He also liked gravy on mashed potatoes--we knew how to mash potatoes, too.  I had just learned to make white gravy, so I was eager to practice.

The chicken was great.  The gravy resembled white, lumpy paste which your granddad heaped on his potatoes as if it were gold star fare.  

Your dad and I disagree about amounts here.  Practice.

After frying chicken, country style steak, pork chops or other meats, remove meat from skillet and keep warm.

Pour excess grease out of skillet, except for 1 to 2 tablespoon.  Leave "crumbles" in the skillet.  Add 2 to 3 tablespoons flour to the skillet over medium heat.  Stir and mix flour with grease until all the flour is absorbed and has cooked 3 or 4 minutes.  Add 1 to 3 cups milk gradually.  Stir continuously to blend well.  Add more milk as needed to make a thick but fluid gravy.  As it cools between skillet and table, it thickens further.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Serve over meats, potatoes, biscuits, or bread slices with the meal.
