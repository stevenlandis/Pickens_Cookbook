Outstanding!  We served 10 pounds of shrimp fixed this way to 27 members of the Red Cliff Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa.  

Sauce:

	1 large carrot, roll cut
	1 red bell pepper, cut
	1 green bell pepper, cut
	1 clove garlic, peeled
	1 lemon
	1 can pineapple chunks with juice
	1 slice ginger
	1 tablespoon oil
	1/2 cup sugar
	1/4 cup vinegar
	1/3 cup water
	2 tablespoons catsup
	2 tablespoons cornstarch
	1/4 cup water

Heat oil in a saucepan.  Infuse the garlic and ginger when oil is hot and remove when browned.  Add sugar, vinegar, pineapple juice, water and catsup.  Stir and heat.  Add lemon wedge and carrots.  Simmer for a few minutes.  Mix cornstarch and water, stir into sauce and bring to a slow boil.  Remove from heat when sauce thickens and clears.

Batter:

	3 tablespoons oil
	1 cup flour or 1/2 cup tapioca flour
	1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	1 tablespoon cornstarch
	1 cup water

Mix the batter ingredients and let set for at least 20 minutes.

Cooking the Shrimp:

1 pound or more shrimp, cleaned and butterflied by cutting down back.  Raw or roast pork, and chicken may be substituted, but shrimp is best.

1 quart oil
1 small can pickled Chinese cucumber threads (optional)

Dip shrimp in the batter.  Deep fry in hot oil.  Drop in hot oil with split side down, a few at a time, until lightly brown.  Fry all the prepared shrimp.  Drain on a tray covered with paper towels.  This cooking can even be done several hours before you wish to serve.  (Shrimp may be frozen at this point.)  

Preheat oven to 425Â°.  Reheat the sauce and add the carrots and pineapple to the sauce.  Place cooked shrimp on clean paper towels on a tray, in one layer.  Place in hot oven for 1 minute.  Remove immediately and place on a platter or flat bowl.  Serve by spooning the vegetable sauce over the shrimp.  Add some of the pickled cucumber threads on top.  Shrimp should be served immediately after second quick heating.
