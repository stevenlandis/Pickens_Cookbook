Cioccolato Paradiso (Biscotti)

@body
Thanks to Sophie Adams, we learned about these biscotti that are a great treat.

	1 ½ cups almonds
	½ cup butter
	1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
	3 eggs, separated
	1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
	Zest of 1 orange, finely chopped
	3 cups all-purpose or unbleached flour
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	¼ teaspoon salt
	1 ¼ cups coarsely chopped milk chocolate

Place nuts in a shallow pan and bake in a preheated 350º oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.  Let cool.  

In a mixing bowl cream butter and ½ cup sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg yolks, vanilla and orange zest.  

In a bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to the creamed mixture, mixing just until crumbly. 

 In a separate bowl beat egg whites until soft peaks form and beat in remaining sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold meringue into the crumbly dough, mixing until it clings together.  

Cut nuts into halves or thirds and fold in along with chocolate.  Divide dough in half.  Form into two logs on a greased and floured baking sheet making them about ½ inch thick, 1 ½ inches wide and 16 inches long, spacing them at least 2 inches apart.  

Bake in the middle of a preheated 325º oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Transfer from the baking sheet to a rack.  Let cool 5 minutes.  

Place on a cutting board.  With a serrated knife slice diagonally at a 45 degree angle about ½ inch thick.  Place the slices upright on a baking sheet and return to the oven at 300º for 10 to 15 minutes to dry slightly.  Let cool on a rack.  

Store in a tightly covered container. If any are left.
