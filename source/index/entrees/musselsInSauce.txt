Jeff Smith – The Frugal Gourmet

	3-4 pounds mussels (clams may be used but mussels are preferred)
	2 tomatoes, chopped
	½ stick butter
	3 tablespoons olive oil
	4 or 5 green onions, chopped
	3 cloves garlic, chopped 
	Pinch of oregano
	Pinch of rosemary
	Tiny handful of fresh-chopped parsley
	Salt and pepper to taste
	½ cup dry white wine
	Cooked pasta of choice. ( I like linguini.)

I personally like more of everything.  Just keep the proportions of the ingredients about the same.

Scrub the mussels in fresh water.  Remove all barnacles, and use a pair of pliers to pull off the little beard.  Do not use mussels that are already open unless they close within a few minutes after tapping them on the sink.

In a large pot, sauté the tomatoes in butter and olive oil. Add the green onions, garlic, oregano, rosemary, and parsley. Sauté for a few minutes until soft. Add a bit of salt and pepper and a good white wine. When all is simmering severely, throw in the cleaned mussels.

Cover the pot, and simmer until the mussels are open and tender.  This should only 5-7 minutes.  I like to stir or shake the pot with the lid on like you flip a pancake half the way through to insure all the mussels and getting heated and have room to open.

You can eat the mussels and then pour the sauce over fresh cooked pasta.  I prefer pouring the mussels and sauce over the fresh cooked pasta together.  You don’t lose anything that way, and it makes a great presentation.  We like grated parmesan or Romano cheese on top.  This recipe makes 4 decent portions. Increase proportions as needed.
