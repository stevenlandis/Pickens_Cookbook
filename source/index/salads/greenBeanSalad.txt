Gourmet, June, 1992

	3 pounds red boiling potatoes
	2/3 cup olive oil
	1 garlic clove
	1/4 cup red-wine vinegar (balsamic vinegar may be substituted)
	1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves or 1 teaspoon crumbled dried, plus rosemary sprigs for garnish
	1 red onion, halved lengthwise and sliced thin lengthwise
	2 pounds green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
	24 Kalamata or Ni√ßoise olives, pitted and halved (Spanish olives may be substituted)

Halve the potatoes, unpeeled, and cut them into 1-inch wedges.  In a large roasting pan heat 1/3 cup of the oil in the middle of a preheated 425 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, add the potatoes, tossing them to coat them with the oil, and roast them, stirring them every 10 minutes, for 30 minutes, or until they are tender.  Let the potatoes cool in the pan. 

In a blender puree the garlic, vinegar, rosemary leaves, and salt to taste.  With the motor running add the remaining 1/3 cup oil in a stream, and blend the dressing until it is emulsified.  
 
In a small bowl of ice and cold water let the onion soak for 5 minutes, drain it well, and pat it dry.

In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the green beans for 5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, and drain them in a colander.  DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Refresh the beans under cold water and pat them dry.

In a very large bowl combine the potatoes, onion, green beans, olives, add the dressing, and toss the salad gently. Serve the salad, garnished with the rosemary sprigs, at room temperature.  Serves 8 to 10 depending upon who is eating it.  This recipe has three steps:  preparing it, dressing it, and eating it.
