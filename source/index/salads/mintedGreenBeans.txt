MINTED GREEN BEANS WITH RED ONION

@body
Gourmet, June, 1992

	2 pounds green beans, trimmed, but kept whole
	1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
	1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar
	1/4 cup olive oil
	3 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves
	1/2 cup finely chopped red onion

In a kettle of boiling water cook the beans for 2 to 4 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and drain them well.  Pat the beans dry with paper towels and chill them, covered, for at least 3 hours or overnight.

In a large bowl whisk together the mustard, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.

Add the beans, mint, and the onion and toss the mixture until it is combined well.  Serves 6.
