Tempura are deep-fried, batter-coated pieces of food.  This batter recipe is very light and golden, not breaded and heavy.

	2 cups flour
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	1 1/4 pints of water 
	1 egg yolk

Sift flour, salt, and baking powder together.  Fold into mixture of egg yolk and water to pancake batter consistency.  Prepare as needed.  Do not store.

Heat deep fry oil to 350Â°.  

Prepare bite-sized pieces of fish, shrimp, mushrooms, broccoli, green onions, celery, carrots, egg plant, or most any other vegetable or meat.  Place a few items at a time in the batter.  With tongs or chopsticks, remove one item at a time from the batter and place in hot oil.  Cook only until golden in color, remove, and drain on paper towels.  If deep fried ahead of time, heat on a tray lined with paper towels in a 450 oven for 1 or 2 minutes immediately before serving.  Remove and serve.

Pieces are very tasty with a few drops of soy sauce, or other combination of sauces, such as soy, sesame, hot chili oil, and green onion.
