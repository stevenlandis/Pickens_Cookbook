Mahani

Steamer required.

	1 cup glutinous rice (required)
	1 cup sugar
	1 1/2 cup coconut cream
	5 eggs
	1/8 teaspoon salt

Wash the rice.  In a separate pan bring 1/2 cup of the coconut cream and 1 cup of water to a boil.  Add the drained rice and-the salt.  Stir constantly until all the water is absorbed.

The rice mixture should be spread over the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan, using a spoon to smooth out the mixture.  Place the filled cake pan in a heated and steaming pot or steamer.  Steam for 15 minutes.

In a bowl, add the eggs, sugar and the 1 cup coconut cream.  Beat lightly until the sugar dissolves.  (If the coconut cream is hard, dissolve with a little hot water).

Pour the beaten egg mixture over the steamed rice.  Return to the hot steamer and steam for 1 hour more.  Remove, let cool, and then cut.

This rice cake is a delicious, soothing, and appropriate following a satay.
