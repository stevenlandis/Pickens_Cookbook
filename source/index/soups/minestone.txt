The great old favorite!  I usually double or triple this recipe when I make it.

	1/4 pound salt pork, diced
	2 quarts hot water
	1 1/2 cups tomato juice
	1 can condensed black bean soup
	6 beef bouillon cubes
	1 small can kidney beans
	1 cup carrots, diced
	1 cup celery, diced
	1 cup turnips (optional in our house)
	1 cup cabbage, chopped
	1 cup green onions, chopped
	1 cup spinach, chopped
	1 teaspoon basil
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon pepper
	3/4 cup spaghetti, broken fine
	1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated.

Saut√© the salt pork in the bottom of a large pot until golden.  Add all the ingredients, except the spaghetti and the cheese.  Cook at 1 hour, covered.  Stir occasionally.  Add broken spaghetti. Stir throughout the soup.  Simmer another 30 minutes.

Serve hot into soup bowls.  Top with parmesan cheese.  Accompany with French bread.  Freezes well.
