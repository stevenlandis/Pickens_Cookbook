Chippewa Fried Bread

@body
This recipe came from my friend who gave me the Chippewa wild rice recipe.  It goes very well with the wild rice dish.  It's tasty, light, and non-greasy and should be tried.  The ingredients are stated as written.
 
	2 1/2 cups flour
	4 heaping teaspoons baking powder
	1 big tablespoon sugar
	1 small teaspoon salt
	1 can evaporated milk
	1 1/2 quarts water
 
Mix all the ingredients only until blended.  Roll or pat out dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle shape.  Cut into pie-shaped wedges about 2 to 2 1/2 inches wide.
 
Carefully lay dough pieces onto preheated cooking oil.  Turn pieces when they are golden on the underside.  Do not overcrowd.  Remove to paper towels.  Serve immediately.
