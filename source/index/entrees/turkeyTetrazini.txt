Oven:  400°

This is a great way to use leftovers.

	2 cups diced cooked turkey
	½ pound spaghetti
	½ pound mushrooms
	4 tablespoons butter
	2 tablespoons flour
	1 cup chicken or turkey stock
	1 cup cream
	2 tablespoons sherry
	Salt and pepper
	Grated Parmesan cheese

Break up spaghetti and cook 9 minutes in boiling, salted water.  Drain well.  Slice the mushrooms with stems and sauté in butter 5 minutes.  Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir to blend well.  Add stock and cream and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened.  Add turkey and heat through.  Line a baking dish with the spaghetti and pour the turkey mixture into the center.  Sprinkle liberally with grated Parmesan cheese and bake in a hot 400° oven until top is golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
