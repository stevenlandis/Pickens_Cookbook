When I was a girl, these were one of the many cookies my family made before the feast of St. Nicholas, December 6.  They need time to "ripen," so they were always just right--and one of my favorites--at Christmas.  

	4 1/2 cups sifted flour
	1 tablespoon cinnamon
	1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
	1 teaspoon ground cloves
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1 cup honey
	1/4 cup molasses
	1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
	1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
	1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange rind
	1/4 cup chopped candied citron (except in our house)
	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	1 egg, well beaten
	1 cup blanched almonds, chopped

Sift the first 5 ingredients together and set aside.

Combine honey, molasses, brown sugar, grated rinds, and citron, if used in a large mixing bowl.  

Combine baking soda and 2 teaspoons hot water and add to the honey mixture along with the beaten egg; mix thoroughly.  

Blend in nuts and flour fixture to form a stiff dough.  Refrigerate overnight to blend flavors.

The next day, roll dough out on floured board into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 3 x 1 inch bars.  Place on a baking sheet.

Bake at 350 about 15 minutes.  Remove cookies to cooling rack.  While still warm, brush with a thin icing made by moistening powdered sugar with lemon juice or orange juice.  

When cool, store cookies in tightly covered container.  Makes about 75 bars.
