Spaghetti Sauce

@body
Gordono's, Andale, Kansas

After we were married for a month, your Dad went to Japan.  I went to Andale.  There I lived for a while, just watching and writing as my cousins worked in the kitchen.

	1 or 2 pork chops or 1 cup pork sausage
	1 to 2 can tomato paste
	1 large can tomato sauce 
	1 can tomato juice or tomato puree or crushed Italian tomatoes

In a skillet, brown and fry the pork chops or pork sausage.  Remove the chops or sausage and use for another purpose.  Save the grease!

To the pork grease, add the tomato paste and your choice of tomato sauce, juice, puree, or Italian tomatoes.  Mix and add the meatballs.  The original recipe says to "cook forever." Simmer over low heat.  The Andalers cooked the gravy for 24 hours.
