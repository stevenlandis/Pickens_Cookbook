(Maybe Bon Appetit)

8 servings

	2 cups uncooked long-grain brown rice (We used a mix of brown and wild rice and a couple of other grains available from ShopRite and health food stores.)
	1 cup Major Grey’s mango chutney (We used Trader Joe’s.) 
	¼ cup olive oil
	2 large unpeeled Granny Smith apples, cored, cut into 1/3-inch cubes
	2 cups thinly sliced celery
	1 cup golden raisins (about 5 ounces)
	¼ cup finely chopped fresh mint
	¼ cup chopped toasted slivered almonds

Cook rice in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, about 35 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to large bowl and cool.

Whisk chutney and oil in small bowl to blend for dressing. Add apples, celery, raisins, mint, and almonds to rice. Toss to combine. Add dressing, toss. Season with salt and pepper. 

Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.

Unsolicited comment from Noah: “Grandmom, it tastes like granola.” It also tastes good the next day.
