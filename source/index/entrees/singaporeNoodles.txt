These are an excellent alternative to rice.

	1 pound rice vermicelli, fine
	1 large onion, cut vertically into 1/4 inch wedges
	1/2 pound peapods, slivered (green beans)
	2 stalks celery, thin sliced
	1 carrot, slivered in 3 inch lengths
	1 scallion, slivered in 3 inch lengths
	3 tablespoons or so of oil
	1 clove garlic
	1 ginger slice
	1 hot dried red pepper
	1 1/2 tablespoon curry powder (may be 1/2 turmeric)
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon sugar
	1/4 cup water or chicken stock

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add noodles for 3 or 4 minutes, drain, and refresh in cold water.  DO NOT OVERCOOK!

Heat wok.  Add 3 tablespoons oil to heat.  Add peeled clove of garlic and slice of ginger to infuse oil in wok.  Remove when brown.

Add to the infused oil the onion, carrots, and peas, and stir fry for a couple of minutes.  Add curry powder, salt, sugar, and water or stock.  Stir fry to blend.  Then add drained noodles.   Toss and stir until noodles are heated.  

Transfer heated noodles to platter or bowl.  Spread the slivered scallion over the top of the noodles when ready to serve.
