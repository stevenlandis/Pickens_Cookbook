	2 eggs, beaten
	1 1/2 cups milk
	2 cups flour
	1 teaspoon baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 cups cooking oil
 
Beat the first 5 ingredients until smooth.  In an 8”-inch skillet, heat the oil to 360º. 
 
Cover the bottom opening in a funnel with your finger; pour a generous 1/2 cup of the batter into the funnel.  Hold the funnel over the heated oil in the skillet.  Release the batter into the hot oil in a spiral motion.  Fry the batter until golden or about 3 minutes.  Turn the cake over in the oil and fry 1 minute longer.
 
Remove the funnel cake from the oil, drain of paper towels, and sprinkle with powdered sugar, or leave off the sugar and use syrup.
 
Repeat the cooking until all the batter is used.
