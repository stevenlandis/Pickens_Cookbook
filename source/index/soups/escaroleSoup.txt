Rose Berardocco

When Albert  married Ann, he also brought the tradition of  his mother's (Rose) escarole soup.  We quickly learned that Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's are just not holidays without this soup being served as a course.  We have joined in celebrating this tradition, thanks to Rose.

	6 pounds escarole
	2  large cans College Inn chicken broth plus 1 can of water (We think 46 oz. cans.)
	1 pound  ground beef
	1 pound  ground veal
	1 pound ground pork
	2 hard  Italian type rolls
	15  eggs
	salt and pepper
	garlic, several cloves, minced
	fresh parsley, a large handful , chopped, or a smaller handful of dried
	Parmesan cheese,  at least a cup or more

Wash the escarole well and steam  in a large pan or wok  until bright green.  Turn frequently so the leaves cook evenly.  Chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces after  they are steamed.

 Place the chopped escarole into a large pot.  Add  the chicken broth and water.  When the meatballs are ready, heat the broth.

Mix the beef, veal, and pork if it didn't come that way  in a large mixing bowl.  Wet the hard rolls with water, squeeze out the excess water, and then add to the ground meat.  Stir 3 eggs  and add to the meat.  Also add  salt, pepper, parsley, minced garlic,  and Parmesan cheese to taste to the meat mixture.  Be generous.   Mix all the ingredients well.  Roll into tiny meatballs about 1/2 inch in diameter.  Fry the meatballs in a large skillet until browned and drain  on paper towels.

Add the meatballs to the hot broth..  Mix the remaining 12 eggs  together in a separate bowl  until they are  almost blended.  Drizzle the beaten eggs into the hot meatball broth  while gently stirring  the broth.  It takes about a minute.  Add more Parmesan cheese to taste. 

Give the soup one final stir and serve immediately.  Crusty bread goes well.  Should there be any soup left, it does freeze well.
