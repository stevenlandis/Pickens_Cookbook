Bishop's Bread

@body
When he was in college, your dad worked as a Sigma Nu kitchen helper who set up and served meals.  He became very friendly with the cooks who used to ply him with pies and coffee cakes which he shared with me after we started going together.  One of our favorites was one the cooks called Bishop's Bread.
