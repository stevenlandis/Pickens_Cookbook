We like to serve this when we have a crowd.  It's spectacular to look at and even better to eat.  

	1 1/2 packages or cakes of yeast
	1 teaspoon sugar
	1/4 cup warm water
	1/2 cup butter
	1/2 cup sugar
	1 teaspoon salt
	3/4 cup scalded milk
	5 cups flour
	3 large eggs
	1 stick butter (melted for dipping dough)

Dissolve yeast and the 1 teaspoon sugar in the warm water.  Combine the butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt.  Pour the scalded milk over these ingredients and stir to melt the butter.  Cool and then add the yeast and half the flour.  Beat in the eggs and beat the batter thoroughly.  Add the rest of the flour to make a soft but non-sticky dough.  Turn the dough out and knead well.  Place in a buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled.  

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a floured board again.  Roll the dough to a thickness of no more than 1/4 inch.  Cut the dough into diamonds, circles, or any shape preferred.  Dip each piece of dough into melted butter and then arrange them in a buttered 10-inch tube pan.  Cover and let the dough rise again until almost doubled.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven for approximately 45 minutes, or until browned and done.  Cover with foil tent if browning too quickly.

Turn out of pan onto cooling rack immediately.
