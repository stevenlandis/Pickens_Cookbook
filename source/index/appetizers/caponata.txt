The Frugal Gourmet, Jeff Smith
 

	2 pounds eggplant
	1 tablespoon salt
	3 tablespoons olive oil
	2 cups celery, chopped in coarse pieces
	3/4 cup peeled, chopped yellow onion
	1/3 cup wine vinegar
	4 teaspoons sugar
	3 cups canned tomatoes, mashed
	2 tablespoons tomato paste
	6 green olives, pitted and chopped
	2 tablespoons capers
	4 or 5 anchovies in oil (May you be so lucky)
	Salt and pepper to taste

 
Cut the un-peeled eggplant into 1-inch cubes.  Dust with the 1 tablespoon salt, and allow to drain in a colander.  Meanwhile, in a little olive oil, sauté the celery along with the onion for about 15 minutes; remove to a side dish.  In the same pan, sauté the drained eggplant for about 10 minutes in a little more oil.  Place all of these in a 2-quart kettle.  Add the wine vinegar, sugar, tomatoes, tomato paste, olives, capers, (and anchovies), and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper.  Chill, and serve.
 
Serve caponata on a bed of lettuce with a few brown crackers.  Serves 10 to 15 as hors d'oeuvre.  Also nice as a salad with a pasta dish.
