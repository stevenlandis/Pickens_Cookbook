Springerli are great to teeth on.

	2 cups sugar
	4 eggs
	4 1/2 cups sifted flour
	4 drops anise oil
	Anise seed for pan

Beat eggs until thick.  Add sugar gradually, beating well between additions; then beat well for about 15 minutes to make the finished cookies fine grained and light.

Add the anise oil and blend.  Fold in the flour lightly.  Roll out the dough about 1/2 inch thick on floured board.  Flour the springerli mold or roller and press carefully but firmly into the dough.

Remove the mold and cut the cookies along the lines of the imprint.  Place on greased cookie sheets.  Flour the mold each time it is used.  Sprinkle anise seed, if desired, on the greased cookie sheets before placing the cookies on them.

Let the uncooked cookies stand overnight in a cool place to dry. 

In the morning, place first in a 375ยบ oven to set the shape, but reduce the heat immediately to 300ยบ.  Bake for 15 minutes.  The cookies should be light in color with the appearance of having been iced.  Makes about 72.

Keep cookies in a tightly covered container 2 or 3 weeks before using to mellow the flavor.  To soften them, put a cut apple in the container a day or tow before using.
