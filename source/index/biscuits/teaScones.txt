A Treasury of Great Recipes, Vincent Price
 
Scones, too, we discovered in England.  There they were often served for tea.  Here, we love them for breakfast, split, steaming, and slathered with lemon curd.  Daddy adapted the following Vincent Price recipe.
 
Preheat oven to 425ยบ.
 

	2 cups flour
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 1/2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder.
	1/4 cup sugar
	1/3 cup shortening
	1/2 cup sultana raisins, plain raisins, or currants
	1 egg
	milk

 
Combine in mixing bowl flour, salt, double-acting baking powder, and sugar.
 
With pastry blender, cut in shortening.  Add sultana raisins, or plain raisins, or currants.
 
Lightly beat 1 egg and add enough milk to make a total of 2/3 cup liquid.  Add liquid to dry ingredients and stir gently with a fork until dough holds together.
 
Gather dough into a ball, place on lightly floured board, and knead gently, about 6 kneading strokes.  Don't work the dough any more than necessary.
 
On a lightly floured board roll dough out, or press out with fingers, to a thickness of about 1/2 to 3/4".  Cut into rounds of 3".  An old tuna can works well.  Place on baking sheet about 1" apart and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.
