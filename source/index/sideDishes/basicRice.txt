Paul Prudomme via Ann Reid

This is a very good full-flavored rice dish to serve with gumbo and other delights from the New Orleans region.

Preheat oven to 350°.

	2 cups rice, raw
	2-1/2 cups chicken stock
	1-1/2 tablespoons onions, finely chopped
	1-1/2 tablespoons celery, finely chopped
	1-1/2 tablespoons bell pepper, finely chopped
	1-1/2 tablespoons melted butter
	½ teaspoon salt
	1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
	pinch each of white pepper, cayenne, and black pepper

Combine all the ingredients above in a bowl.  After mixing well, pour mixture into a greased 5” x 9” x 2-1/2 –inch loaf pan.  Seal top with foil and bake in a 350° oven for 70 minutes.

Transfer to a serving bowl and serve.  Chopped parsley could be sprinkled on top of the rice.  This recipe makes about 6 cups of cooked rice.
