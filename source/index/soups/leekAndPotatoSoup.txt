Brother Victor-Antoine d’Avila-Latourrette: Twelve Months of Monastery Soups

During our first visit to Ecuador, we learned that Ecuadorians eat many soups as first courses with meals. Soups usually have a potato base.  When we returned we looked in one of our favorite books for an appropriate soup recipe. 

6 servings

	4 T butter or oil of choice
	8 leeks, cleaned and cut into small, round slices
	8 cups water or chicken or vegetable stock
	5 large potatoes, peeled and diced
	Salt and pepper to taste
	Chervil or parsley

Heat the butter or oil in a large soup pot and add the leeks. Sauté for about 3 minutes or until they start to turn translucent. Then add potatoes and liquid. Cook over medium heat, covered, for about 50 to 60 minutes. The vegetables should be soft.

Add salt and pepper to taste. Mash the potatoes in the soup pot. We use a blender. Dish out each serving and sprinkle a bit of minced chervil or parsley on top. Chive works too. Freezes well.
