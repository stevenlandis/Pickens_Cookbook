	1/2 cup cornmeal (white or yellow)
	2 3/4 cups water, boiling
	3/4 teaspoon salt
	1 tablespoons sugar (optional)
 
Sprinkle cornmeal into boiling water, stirring constantly.  Add salt.  Cook 30 minutes over direct heat, or 1 hour in a double-boiler.  Stir frequently, particularly if cooking over direct heat.
 
Pour hot cooked batter into a greased bread loaf pan.  Smooth out surface of mush.  Cool until firm.  Refrigerate.
 
Cut cooled mush into slices about ¼” thick.  Fry in a skillet or on a grill, turning to brown on both sides.  Mom liked to lay the slices on a plate of flour, shake off excess, and then fry to make them crustier.  Fry the mush in a little oil and margarine.  Good with syrup and fried eggs.  Great breakfast on a cold morning.
