Hot Cross Buns

A World of Breads, Dolores Casella

These are for Lent and Good Friday.

Preheat oven to 375ยบ.

	2 cups scalded milk
	1 cup butter
	1 cup sugar
	2 cakes yeast dissolved in 1/3 cup warm water
	2 large eggs
	8 cups flour
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 cups currants or raisins
	1/2 cup candied fruit peels (optional)
	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg

Pour the scalded milk over the butter and sugar.  Let cool to lukewarm.  Add the dissolved yeast and the eggs and blend well.  Add the flour and salt gradually, reserving a small amount of flour to dust the fruits.  Add the floured fruits and the spice to the dough and knead in thoroughly.  

Place the dough in a buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled.  Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a floured board.  Shape the dough into 30 buns and place on buttered cookie sheets.  Cover and let rise for 30 minutes, then carefully press the shape of a cross into each bun, using a spatula or the back of a knife.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350ยบ and continue baking until buns are browned and done, about 10 to 15 minutes longer.  Frost either the entire bun or just the shape of a cross.

Frosting:  Beat 1 egg white until stiff, adding powdered sugar gradually until mixture is thick.  Flavor with 1 teaspoon lemon juice or vanilla extract, or 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  If the frosting thins, add more powdered sugar.

No one in the family really likes candied fruit, so we go with the raisins.  My buns never held the shape of the cross indention, but it does serve as a guide to put the frosting for the cross.
