This recipe makes a number of rolls but they don't stay around long because they are a classic example of good cooking down on the farm.

Preheat oven to 425ยบ.

	1 large can evaporated milk
	1/3 pound butter
	2/3 cup warm water
	2 packages yeast
	1/3 cup warm water
	3/4 cup sugar
	flour, as needed
	1 tablespoon salt
	1 egg

Dissolve yeast in 1/3 cup warm water.  Heat evaporated milk, 2/3 cup water, butter, and sugar to boiling point.  Stir frequently while heating.  

Add enough flour to make a soft batter while the milk is still hot.  Let cool to lukewarm and add the dissolved yeast.  Cover and set aside in a warm spot until batter is bubbly.  Stir down and add salt and egg.  Blend well.  Then add enough flour to make a soft but workable dough.  Let the dough rise until double.   Work the dough down and shape into rolls and place in pans.

Let rolls rise in pans and bake at 425ยบ for about 20 minutes.
