Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

	1/2 pound spaghetti
	1 pound ground beef
	1 cup onions, chopped
	1 cup frozen peas
	1 can ripe olives, sliced
	1 46 ounce can tomato juice
	8 to 10 slices Velveeta cheese

Cook spaghetti to al dente only.  Reserve in a large bowl.

While spaghetti is cooking, brown ground beef in a skillet.  When brown, drain excess fat from skillet and then add chopped onions to beef in skillet.  Cook until onions are translucent, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat and add peas and ripe olives.  Then pour meat mixture onto cooked spaghetti and mix well.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Pour meat and spaghetti mixture into a 10 to 13 inch buttered baking pan or casserole.  Pour tomato juice over contents until the level of the juice can clearly be seen.  If additional liquid is needed, add water.

Cover entire surface of filling with slices of Velveeta cheese.  No substitutions seem to work.

Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until cheese begins to brown on top.  Watch carefully to avoid overcooking. I remember asking Mom (Edith Steiner) how this dish got its name.  She said, "When you eat it, you always want 'More'."
