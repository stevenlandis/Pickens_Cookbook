Greek Cooking of the Gods, so Ginny Newman in Cherry Hill called it.

Serves 12

Preheat oven to 350º.

	3 eggplant
	2 pounds ground lamb or ground beef
	2 onions, chopped
	1 garlic clove, minced
	1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
	1/4 teaspoon fines herbes
	1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
	1/2 tablespoon parsley
	1 can tomato sauce (8 ounce)
	1/2 cup red wine
	olive oil
	butter
	salt and pepper
	4 cups Béchamel sauce
	3 egg yolks
	1/4 to 1/2 cup grated cheese

Peel and cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/2 inch slices, sprinkle with salt, and set aside on paper towels to drain.

Meat sauce:
Sauté the meat in butter and season with salt and pepper.  Add onions and garlic to meat.  Stir to crumble.  When meat is browned, add cinnamon and nutmeg, fines herbes, and tomato sauce.  Stir, mix well, add wine, and simmer mixture for 20 minutes.

Wipe the salted eggplant; lightly oil a skillet and quick fry the eggplant over high heat.  Add oil to skillet, if necessary.  Layer browned eggplant on paper towels to drain.  

Add 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the béchamel sauce.

In a greased 9 x 13 inch baking pan, place a layer of browned eggplant, top with meat mixture, and sprinkle with grated cheese.  Cover with remaining eggplant, béchamel sauce, and bake at 350 for one hour.

For an especially rich sauce, add 3 egg yolks to the sauce after it is cooked.  Lightly whip the egg yolks.  Stir several tablespoons of hot sauce into the egg yolks.  Stir the warmed yolks into the hot béchamel sauce and mix well.
