This is one of those recipes that looked impossible to eat—all those whole lemons.  It is truly delicious and never fails to please lemon lovers.

Preheat oven to 400º.

	Pie crust for top and bottom crust
	4 eggs, slightly beaten
	2 1/2 cups sugar
	1/2 cup water
	2 tablespoons melted butter
	Pinch of salt and nutmeg
	3 large lemons

Line a 9-inch pie tin with a bottom crust.  Reserve the top crust.

Combine the eggs, sugar, water, melted butter, salt and nutmeg in a bowl.  Grate the rind from 2 lemons, remove all white membrane, and cut the lemons into very thin slices.  Cut another lemon, with rind intact, into very thin slices.  Add the lemon slices and lemon rind to the egg mixture and pour it into the pastry shell.

Roll out the reserved pastry for the top crust, and crimp the edges together.  Bake the pie in a hot oven (400º) for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 and bake for 30 minutes longer.  Let the pie cool before serving.

This is a different kind of pie and really very good.  Heaven for a lemon lover.
