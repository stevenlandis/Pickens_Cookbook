Vanilla Ice Cream

Barbara DuPuy

When I was a little girl, my aunt made ice cream in the summertime.  She would put the freezer on the back porch--one with sides up half way and screens on top.  The porch housed the wringer washing machine and rinse tubs, an old striped glider, and some odds and ends of chairs.

My cousins turned the freezer crank.  Oh, they gave me a turn or two, but mostly they turned.  Aunt Kappie would add more ice from time to time, and, when the ice cream began to thicken, the boys would heap in the ice, cover the lumpy freezer with an old rag rug, and perch me on top to help hold the ice in.  

When the ice cream was ready, Aunt Kappie would give me the beaters to lick, and pack the freezer to let the ice cream set up.  

Barbara DuPuy's recipe is an old-fashioned ice cream--and it tastes as good today as it did years ago.  We like to invite a crowd in the summer--or have all of you come home--and invite people to take a turn at the crank.

	4 eggs
	2 1/2 cups sugar
	1/2 gallon whole milk
	1 pint heavy cream
	2 tablespoons vanilla
	1/2 teaspoon salt

Beat eggs until light.  Add sugar and beat until mixture thickens.  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Freeze and eat!

Because this recipe makes 1 gallon of ice cream, the milk can be added to the freezer after the other ingredients have been mixed.  The freezer paddles will then do the mixing.

Due to concerns about eating raw eggs, cook the custard first, cool and then freeze.
