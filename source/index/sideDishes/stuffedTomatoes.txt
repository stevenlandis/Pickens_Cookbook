30-Minute Meals, Rachel Ray, Food Network

	4 vine ripe tomatoes, red or yellow, tops trimmed and seeded  (Mary uses a melon baller to scoop out the insides.)
	Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
	Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
	1/2 cup bread crumbs or 1 slice, 1/2-inch thick, stale crusty bread, torn 
	1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
	1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
	1 clove garlic, chopped 
	2 cups arugula leaves, the tops of 1 bunch 

Preheat oven to 400Â°.
Arrange tomatoes on a broiler pan. Drizzle tomatoes with oil and season with salt and pepper. Combine bread crumbs, cheese, red pepper flakes, garlic, arugula and 1 tablespoon oil in food processor and pulse grind to form stuffing.  Loosely stuff tomatoes to the rims with arugula mixture and place in the center of the oven. Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Let tomatoes stand 5 minutes before serving.
