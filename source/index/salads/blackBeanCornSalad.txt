This substantial salad travels well.  Made without the avocado, it will keep in the refrigerator up to a week.  Then add the avocado, if desired, just before serving.

	Two 15-ounce cans black beans, rinsed and drained
	1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
	½ cup olive oil
	1 garlic clove, minced
	1 teaspoon fine sea salt
	1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
	1 ears corn, kernels cut off the cob, or 1-1/2 cups canned or defrosted-frozen corn
	1 avocado, peeled, stone removed, and cut into ½” pieces
	1 small red pepper, seeded and cut into 1/2” pieces
	2 medium tomatoes, cut into ½” pieces
	6 green onions, with tops, finely chopped
	1 fresh hot chile pepper, seeded and minced
	½ cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, optional

Put the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, salt and cayenne in a small jar.  Cover with the lid and shake until the ingredients are well mixed.  

In a salad bowl, combine the beans, corn, avocado, bell pepper, tomatoes, green onions, chile pepper and cilantro.  Shake the lime dressing and pour it over the salad.  Stir until well-coated.  The salad can be prepared a few hours ahead, but don’t add the avocado until serving time.  Refrigerate, and adjust the seasonings before serving.
