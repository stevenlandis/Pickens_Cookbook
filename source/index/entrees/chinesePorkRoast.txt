This roast pork is a basic ingredient and flavoring in a number of recipes from soup to fried rice to steamed buns.  It is tasty just by itself, so it is good to have some around.  It freezes well.

	2 pounds boneless pork tenderloin, fat removed
	1 clove garlic, crushed
	3 tablespoons soy sauce
	1 tablespoon sherry
	1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
	Freshly ground black pepper
	2 teaspoons sugar
	1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
	1/4 teaspoon ground star anise
	2 tablespoons oil
	2 tablespoons honey

Cut pork along the grain into pieces 6 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  Mix the remaining ingredients except the oil and honey in a shallow dish (or plastic bag).  Add the pork and coat it on all sides with the mixture.  Let stand 2 or 3 hours, turning the pork slices once during the period.  

Drain and reserve the marinade.  Transfer the pork to a rack with a drip pan underneath.  Place a shallow pan of hot water on the bottom of a preheated 425° oven.  Roast the pork in the oven 15 minutes.

Combine 2 tablespoons reserved marinade with the oil.  Brush the pork with this mixture.  Turn the pork and brush the other side.

Reduce the heat to 350 and roast another 10 minutes.  

Brush the pork with honey.  Turn the slices and brush the other side.  Continue to roast 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and slice pork across the grain into ¼ inch thick slices.  Serve hot or cold or use as directed in other recipes.
