	24 clams, chopped
	1 1/2 cup flour
	1 cup corn
	salt and pepper
	3 egg yolks
	2 tablespoons baking powder
	1/4 cup scallions, chopped
	3/4 cup clam juice
	3 egg whites, beaten stiff
	Combine the ingredients above, adding the beaten egg whites last by folding then into the blended batter.

Heat 2 tablespoons or so of oil in a hot skillet.  Add the clam batter by the large spoonful to form the individual fritter.  Do not overcrowd the skillet.  Turn fritter over when golden brown to cook both sides.  Remove to paper towels when done.  Keep warm.
