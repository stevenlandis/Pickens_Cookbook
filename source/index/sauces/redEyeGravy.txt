After ham has been pan fried or baked, remove the meat and set aside to keep warm.  Pour 1/2 to 3/4 cup water in the same skillet or pan over medium high heat and stir to dissolve juices and "cracklins" left in the skillet.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce or add water as necessary.  Cook until flavor is blended and rich.

Serve over meats, biscuits, potatoes, or eggs.

Marsala, Madeira, or other wine may be added to flavor.  Stir and blend in 1 pat of butter before serving.
