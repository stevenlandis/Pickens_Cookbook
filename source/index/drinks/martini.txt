PERFECT MARTINI

@body
The Basin in Saratoga, CA, with improvements by Danny McLaughlin

	Equal portions of Bombay Sapphire gin and Ketel One or Grey Goose vodka
	Lemon and orange twists

Rinse martini glasses with cool water and chill in the freezer.

Sprits glasses with vermouth.  If you donâ€™t have a spritzer, swirl vermouth around the glass and pour out any extra.  

Fill 2/3 of the martini shaker with crushed ice.  Pour in gin and vodka.  Shake 10-15 times.  If you use ice cubes, shake vigorously 20 times. 

Drop in lemon and orange twists.  Cheers!
