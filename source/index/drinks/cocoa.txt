Cocoa Mix

Amy Oriani

Makes 100 cups.

We drank many cups of this cocoa after school and in the evenings.  It was very convenient, even before the microwave era.

	2 cups powdered sugar
	1 pound Nestles QUICK
	6 ounces non-dairy creamer
	1 4-quart box powdered milk (or 1 1/3 cups powdered milk)

Mix all ingredients well and store in air-tight container.

For one drink, mix 1/4 to 3/4 cup prepared mix to a cup of hot water, depending on your taste.
