Moosewood Cookbook, Mollie Katzen

Until she moved from the dorms, for two years Paula complained about the food at Tyler School of Art.  Her prime example was the chef's insistence that he served great "rah-taw-too-lee."

	1 medium onion, chopped
	2 medium bell peppers, in strips or cubes
	2 small or 1 medium zucchini, cubed (or summer squash or a combination)
	1 small eggplant, cubed
	4 cloves crushed garlic
	2 medium tomatoes, in chunks
	1 bay leaf
	1 teaspoon each:  basil, marjoram
	1/2 teaspoon oregano
	dash of ground rosemary
	3 tablespoons burgundy or any dry red wine
	1/2 cup tomato juice
	2 tablespoons tomato paste
	2 teaspoons salt (approximately)
	black pepper to taste
	1/4 cup olive oil
	fresh chopped parsley

Heat olive oil in large, heavy cooking pot.  Crush the garlic into the oil.  Add bay leaf and onion; salt lightly.  Saut√© over medium heat until onion begins to turn transparent.  Add eggplant, wine, tomato juice, and herbs.  Stir to mix well; then cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes.  Add salt, pepper, tomatoes, and tomato paste.  Mix well.  Stew until tender

Just before serving, mix in fresh parsley.

Serve on a bed of rice, or in a bowl, accompanied by some good French bread.  Top with grated cheese and chopped black olives.
