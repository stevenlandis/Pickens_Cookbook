Red, White & Greens, Faith Willinger

	1 celery stalk, chopped
	1 medium carrot, chopped
	1 medium onion, chopped
	2 T. extra virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish
	1 pound winter squash, peeled and cubed (Hubbard, banana, or butternut), about 3 cups
	½ pound all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cubed, about 1 ½ cups
	1 whole hot pepper
	3 ½ cups boiling water or light stock (chicken or vegetable)
	2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
	1 amaretti cookie for garnish (optional)

Put the chopped celery, carrot and onion in a 3-quart pot and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Stir to coat the vegetables with the oil, and place over low heat.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, but not brown.

Add the squash, potatoes and hot pepper, and cover with the boiling water or broth. Season with salt.

Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender

Remove and discard the hot pepper and blend the vegetables and their broth in a food processor or with an immersion mixer until smooth. Keep the soup hot.

Place the amaretti cookie in a small plastic bag and crush to form fine crumbs.

Ladle the soup into bowls.  Garnish with a pinch of amaretti crumbs and a drizzle of olive oil.
