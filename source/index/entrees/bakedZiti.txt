Baked Ziti

@body
Connie Briglia’s greatest contribution to family get-togethers, and one of Conner’s favorites.

	1 ¼ package ziti (16 oz), cooked and drained
	1 ½ pound ground beef, browned and drained well
	1-15 oz. container ricotta cheese
	¼ cup chopped parsley
	½ cup grated parmesan cheese
	¾ teaspoon salt
	1 ½ quart spaghetti sauce (or canned Man-wich Sloppy Joe mix)
	1 egg
	20 oz. shredded mozzarella cheese

In very large bowl, mix cooked ground beef, ricotta, parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, pepper, egg and half of the spaghetti sauce until well mixed. Add cooked ziti and toss gently. Add ¾ of the mozzarella cheese, and toss gently again until mixed. 

Place in greased pan. Top with remaining sauce and mozzarella. 

Bake at 350° about ½ hour until bubbly.

To reduce fat and calories, substitute ground turkey (or omit meat altogether), and use low- or no-fat cheese products.
