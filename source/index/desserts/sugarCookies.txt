	2 cups sifted flour
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/3 cup butter
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	1 cup sugar
	1 egg, beaten
	1 tablespoon milk

If you use vanilla sugar, eliminate the vanilla extract.

Sift first 3 ingredients together.  Cream butter, vanilla, and sugar together; add egg and beat until fluffy.  Blend in the milk.  Add dry ingredients gradually, mixing well.  Wrap the dough in wax paper and chill for 3 to 4 hours.

Roll on a floured surface or between wax paper sheets about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters.  Place on lightly buttered or oil-sprayed cookie sheet.  You can also roll the dough on a cookie sheet, cut into desired shape, and remove the excess dough.

Decorate with colored sugar or decorettes.  Bake at 400 for 6 to 8 minutes or until cookies are lightly browned around the edges.  Remove to cooling racks.  Frost with confectioners' sugar icing if desired.
