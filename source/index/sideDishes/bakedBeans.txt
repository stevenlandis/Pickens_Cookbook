Baked Beans

@body
These are my doctored baked beans which seem to go pretty good when Mary or Joe are around.

	1 pound can baked beans
	1/2 cup chopped bacon or ham
	1 small onion, chopped
	1/4 cup catsup
	2 tablespoons brown sugar
	1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke

Sauté the bacon or ham in a heavy pot until softened.  An easy source of the bacon or ham is to make a couple of 1/4 inch cuts across the fatty end of a pound of sliced bacon.  Then add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.  Cook on top of the stove until heated, and the flavors are blended.  Cook with no lid.  Stir occasionally.

The preferred method of cooking is to mix and bake, uncovered, in a 350° oven or enclosed barbeque, not over the coals, for about 30 minutes or until the surface of the baked beans has slightly thickened.  Do not stir.  Serve hot or cold.
