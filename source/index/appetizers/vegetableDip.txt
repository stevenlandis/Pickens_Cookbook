Vegetable Dip

@body
Although this one’s not “homemade” – it’s off the Knorr’s Vegetable Soup Mix box – it’s always in demand at the Berardocco’s and Wengerd’s.
 
	1 package (10 oz.) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained well (I like to use two boxes)
	1 container (16 oz.) low fat sour cream
	1 cup lite mayonnaise
	1 package Knorr Vegetable Soup, Dip & Recipe Mix
	1 can (8 oz.) water chestnuts, drained and chopped (optional)
	3 green onions, chopped.
 
In medium bowl, stir all ingredients until well mixed.
 
Cover; chill 2 hours to blend flavors.
 
Stir well. Serve with cut up vegetables or chips.  Blanch the snap peas and broccoli first for best results.
