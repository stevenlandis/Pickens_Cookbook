Brother Victor-Antoine d’Avila-Latourrette: Twelve Months of Monastery Soups

Thanks to a good tomato crop we were able to Brother Victor’s recipes again.    

4 servings

	½ cup olive oil
	1 large onion, finely diced
	7 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled and chopped (Canned diced tomatoes also work well.)
	2 garlic cloves, minced
	1 celery stalk, thinly sliced
	2 carrots, thinly sliced
	2 T fresh basil, chopped
	1 bay leaf
	1 t thyme or leaves stripped from several sprigs of fresh thyme
	2 bouillon cubes dissolved in a little hot water or stock (We have found Maggi chicken, beef, or vegetarian bouillon cubes to work very well in any soup-not too salty.)
	6 cups water or chicken stock
	1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped or 1 package frozen chopped spinach
	Salt and pepper to taste
	Parmesan or Romano cheese, grated

Heat oil and add onions and tomatoes. Sauté the vegetables slightly for 3 or 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, celery, carrots, basil, bay leaf, and thyme. Stir well and continue sautéing for another 2 minutes.

Add the bouillon cubes and water or the stock and bring the soup to a boil. Cover the pot and simmer the soup for 50 to 60 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf.

Add the spinach, salt, and pepper and continue cooking for another 10 minutes.  Stir well.  Turn off the heat, and let the soup stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Serve hot and sprinkle some grated cheese on top.
