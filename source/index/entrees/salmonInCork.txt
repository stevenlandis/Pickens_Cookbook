Salmon In Cork Husk Boats

@body
Salmon, James McNair, with comments from Paula and Mary

	4 ears of corn, unhusked
	4 salmon filets, 1/3 pound each, trimmed to 1 to 1½” wide.
	8 sea scallops or a bunch of bay scallops
	Butter
	Salt and pepper to taste
	4 Tablespoons lemon juice

Loosen husks and cut off cob near the base.  Cut corn from the cob.  Discard silk from husks. 

Lay out husk like a boat on the workspace.  Place strips of salmon inside the husk “boat.”  Top each with 2 sea scallops or a handful of bay scallops.  Place loose corn on top of scallops and salmon.  Dot with butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Squeeze 1 tablespoon of juice over each salmon, corn and scallop boat.

Cover ingredients with husk (should look like original, unhusked cob), and tie end and middle to stay closed.  If the husks don’t close you can also tightly wrap them in foil. 

Grill until done, turning as husks darken – OR – bake at 350°, turning husks occasionally, until done, usually 25 minutes or so.

OR – if fresh corn isn’t available:

Spray decorative baking dish with nonstick spray. Cover bottom of dish with ½ to 1” layer of corn-off-the-cob. Place salmon filets on top. Top with scallops. Dot with butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Cover with foil, and bake until done.
