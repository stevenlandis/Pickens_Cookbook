Preheat oven to 425º.

	2 eggs
	3/4 cup sugar
	3/4 cup Crisco
	1 teaspoon salt
	3 cups warm water
	2 packages yeast
	8 to 9 cups flour

Cream the sugar and Crisco.  Add the eggs and salt and blend.  Dissolve the yeast in the water.  When dissolved, add to the mixture.  

Thicken with the flour.  A mixer is recommended, but not necessary.  Add the flour gradually until a soft workable dough is made.  Remove from bowl and knead on floured breadboard, adding flour as necessary but still soft.

Place in oiled bowl and let rise until doubled, about 1 ½ hours.

Work down and squeeze off dough into rolls.  Dough pieces (rolls) should be about 2 inches in diameter.  Place in greased pans.  Muffin tins will hold 3 1-inch balls for cloverleaf rolls.

Bake at 425º for 5 minutes.  Lower temperature to 375º and bake another 15 to 20 minutes or until browned and done.  When using a pan approximately 10 by 13 inches, the longer time will be needed to insure the rolls in the center get done.

The dough can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator.  About 3 hours will be required for the dough to rise if it is cold.  I bake the whole batch at once, and then freeze the baked rolls.

This recipe makes about 40 to 50 rolls.
