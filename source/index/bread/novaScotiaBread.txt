Nova Scotia Bread

@body
When we arrived in Nova Scotia, we stopped at a road-side stand for cheese, bread, and fresh Royal Anne cherries for a picnic lunch on the way to Evangeline country.  The bread was new for us, but it was delicious, and we kept finding it throughout the province at homes featuring "Baked Goods" signs in the windows.

We left Nova Scotia without a recipe, and traveled through New Brunswick before stopping one evening in Woodstock.  A woman was selling baked goods throughout the campground from her station wagon.  She had the bread we had come to call Nova Scotia, and your dad asked if she had a recipe.  She said she'd bring it by after she completed her round.

She returned with the following recipe penciled on the back of cash register strip from a grocery.  What follows is that recipe with one exception:  Daddy put in the amount of flour he uses.

Preheat oven to 300ยบ.

Stir 3 tablespoons sugar into 2 cups warm water.  Sprinkle 3 cakes dry yeast on top and let set until dissolved.

Crush 4 shredded wheat biscuits into big mixing bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons salt, shortening the size of a large egg, 1 cup molasses, and 2 cups warm milk (dry milk works well).  Add 4 cups warm water and mix well.  Add flour.  You will use about 16 cups depending on the weather.

Let dough rise for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.  Punch down and divide into 4 to 6 pieces depending on the size of loaf pans.  Grease pans well.  Divide each piece of dough in half.  Shape each half piece into a ball, and place the two balls into a single loaf pan.  Let rise, covered, until dough reaches top edge of loaf pan.  Bake one hour.
