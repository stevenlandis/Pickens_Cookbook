Chopsticks

	1 1/2 pounds large shrimp
	1/2 cup ketchup
	1 tablespoon cornstarch
	4 tablespoons oil or lard
	2 teaspoons salt
	2 or 3 green onions
	4 slices ginger
	1/2 teaspoon rice wine

Clean and drain the shrimp.

Cut the white part of the onions into 1 inch pieces.  Cut the ginger into narrow shreds.  Mix onions and ginger in a small bowl.

Mix cornstarch, 4 tablespoons water, sugar, and soy sauce together to make a paste.

Heat the wok and add 1 or 2 tablespoons oil.  When hot, cook shrimp 4 or 5 minutes or until turning pink and white.  Add salt, ketchup, green onion, ginger, and wine.  Stir and fry for 1 minute.  Add cornstarch paste mixture.  If too thick, add a little water.  Cook and stir 1 minute more.  Remove and serve.
