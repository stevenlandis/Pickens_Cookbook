Salad Dressing

We first tasted this dressing at Paula’s and finally got the recipe from her.  It works well on a variety of salads and certainly is an excellent alternative to the usual salad dressing flavors that are available.  It also keeps well in the refrigerator.  Use only real maple syrup.  It’s worth it.

	¾ cup vegetable oil
	¼ cup red wine vinegar
	2 cloves chopped garlic
	2 chopped shallots
	½ teaspoon fresh ground pepper
	¼ cup Dijon mustard
	¼ cup Pommery mustard
	½ cup maple syrup 
	salt to taste

Emulsify the oil and vinegar.  Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
