Pickled Cucumber Salad

Mei Ling Moy

A very refreshing salad and good with many Chinese and non-Chinese foods.  We took our largest container to the Penn State Parents' Weekend and picnic--and we consumed it to the last shred of cabbage.

	1 1/2 pounds pickling cucumbers, sliced as described below
	4 small red peppers, sliced, or 1 carrot, sliced
	2 tablespoons salt
	1/2 cup wine vinegar
	4 tablespoons sugar
	1 tablespoon sesame oil
	1 Chinese cabbage, shredded

Cut off the stem end of the cucumber, cut in half the long way, and then slice each half cucumber into slices at an angle.  Do this with all the cucumbers to be used.  In a bowl, add the cucumbers, peppers or carrot and mix with the salt.  Let set for 1 hour or more. 

Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.  Let the marinade cool.  When cooled, pour the marinade over the rinsed cucumber mixture and let set overnight.

Put a bed of shredded Chinese cabbage on a platter or plate.  Shred only what you need for the bed, and save the rest of the head or other uses.  On top of the shredded cabbage, put the cucumber mixture, and serve.
