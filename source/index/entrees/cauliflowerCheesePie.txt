Moosewood Cookbook, Mollie Katzen

This makes a splendid supper entree.

	Crust:
	2 cups, packed, grated raw potato
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1 egg, beaten
	1/4 cup grated onion

Heat oven to 400º.

Set the freshly-grated potato in a colander over a bowl.  Salt it and leave it for 10 minutes.  Then squeeze out the excess water and mix potatoes with egg and onion.  Pat it into a well-oiled, 9-inch pie or cake pan, building up the sides of the crust with lightly-floured fingers.  Bake for 40-45 minutes until browned.  After the first 30 minutes, brush the crust with a little oil to crisp it.

Remove crust from oven when done and turn oven down to 375º.

Filling:
	1 heaping packed cup of grated cheddar cheese
	1 medium cauliflower, broken into small flowerets
	1 medium chopped onion
	3 tablespoons butter
	dash of thyme
	1/2 teaspoon basil
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 eggs plus 1/4 cup milk beaten together
	black pepper 
	paprika
	1 clove crushed garlic

Sauté onions and garlic, lightly salted, in butter for 5 minutes.  Add herbs and cauliflower and cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Spread half the cheese into the baked potato crust, then the sauté, then the rest of the cheese.  Pour the custard over the pie and dust with paprika.  Bake 35-40 minutes until set.
