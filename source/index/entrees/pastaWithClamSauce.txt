The Frugal Gourmet, Jeff Smith

	5 cloves garlic, crushed
	5 tablespoons olive oil
	6 stalks celery, chopped
	2 small zucchini, sliced thin
	4 green onions, chopped
	1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced
	2 ripe small tomatoes, chopped coarse
	3 tablespoons parsley, chopped
	1 6 ½ ounce can clams
	1/4 cup white wine
	Salt and pepper to taste
	1 pound pasta, cooked
	Fresh-grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

Sauté the garlic in the oil for a few minutes.  Do not brown too much.  Add celery, zucchini, green onions, mushrooms, and parsley, and sauté until all is barely tender.  Add the clams, juice and all, the wine, salt, and pepper (a good amount of fresh ground).  Simmer for a few more minutes.  If too much juice, remove the solids from the pan and reduce the liquid over high heat very quickly.  Blend in the solids again, and serve over hot pasta.  Top with cheese.

Serves 8 as a first course.  We like it as a main course.
