Daddy returned from fishing on the St. Lawrence one year with a request from the boys for his meatloaf recipe.  He had never written it down and wasn't too sure what he had put into the one he made in Canada.  What follows is a reasonable facsimile.

	2 pounds ground beef
	1 cup oatmeal
	1 cup onions, chopped
	1 egg
	1/2 cup green pepper, chopped
	1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
	1/2 cup catsup
	Salt and pepper
	2 slices bacon


In a large bowl combine all the ingredients except the bacon.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Blend well.  Add more catsup if needed to develop a smooth but firm texture.  If too thin, add a little more oatmeal.

Form meatloaf into a long loaf approximately 4 inches wide and 3 inches high in the shape of a large brick on top of a broiler pan.  Use the back edge of a knife to cross-hatch the top of the loaf for decoration.  Lay the strips of bacon on top of the meatloaf.  Bake at 350 for about 1 hour.

It helps to spray or grease the parts of the broiler pan before molding the meatloaf to reduce clean-up efforts.
