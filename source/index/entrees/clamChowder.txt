From Jeff Smith's TV show, The Frugal Gourmet

	1 quart chicken stock
	6 stalks celery, chopped
	2 onions, chopped
	Salt and pepper
	1/2 teaspoon thyme
	1 1/2 pounds potatoes, cubed with skins on
	1 stick butter
	1/2 cup flour
	2 cups milk
	1 or 2 chopped tomatoes
	3 6-1/2 ounce cans chopped clams and juice

Sautee the celery and onions.  In a 4-quart or larger pot, add the chicken stock, saut√©ed celery and onions, seasonings, and potatoes.  Simmer until tender.

In another smaller pan, melt the butter, and gradually stir in the flour until totally absorbed.  Cook this roux for a few minutes, and then slowly add the hot milk, stirring constantly to blend thoroughly.  Add this roux, a bit at a time to the stock pot, stirring to blend in.

Add the chopped tomatoes.  Simmer this mixture until hot and cooked.  Add the clams and clam juice last.  Heat to temperature only.  Serve immediately.  Freezes well.
