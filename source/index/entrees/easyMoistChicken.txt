Easy Moist Chicken

This is a very simple, easy, and good method to prepare chicken and have it ready for a variety of dishes.

Bring a large pot of water to boil.  When the water reaches a rolling boil, ease in a cleaned whole chicken, or 2 halves of chicken.  The water will stop boiling.  Remove the chicken immediately.  Bring the water back to a rolling boil.  Put the chicken back in the pot of water.  Put the lid on the pot.  Turn off the heat and leave it that way for 1 hour.  Do not peek.

After the 1 hour, remove the chicken from the pot.  Remove the skin from the chicken as soon as it can be handled.  Next, remove all the meat from the bones.  Cool and reserve the meat as you choose.  At this point, the meat can be frozen for future use.

Discard the water in the big pot.  It has no flavor because the first dip in the pot sealed the surface of the chicken.  

The bones and if you choose, the skin, along with an onion, carrot, celery stalk, and other seasonings, can be cooked down for chicken stock.

Remember to pull the meat from the bones.  Do not cut it off.
