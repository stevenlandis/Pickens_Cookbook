A World of Baking, Dolores Casella

Preheat oven to 450ยบ

Pastry for a 2-crust, 9-inch pie
	1 to 1 1/4 cups sugar
	1/4 to 1/3 cup flour
	1 tablespoon lemon juice, or 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
	4 cups ripe berries
	2 tablespoons butter

Combine sugar and flour.  Stir well.  Add lemon juice or cinnamon and the berries.  Stir gently but well.  Pour into pastry-lined pie pan.  Dot with butter.  Arrange top crust over filling.  Flute and seal the edges.  Cut vents in top crust.  Brush top crust lightly with milk and sprinkle with a tablespoon of sugar.

Bake in a 450ยบ oven for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350ยบ and bake 40 to 45 minutes longer.

A piece of foil on the oven rack below the rack with the pie will save cleaning the oven of baked-on juice drips.
