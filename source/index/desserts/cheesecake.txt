Cheescake

@body
A student in one of my Shakespeare classes asked about Dry Sack one evening, and before I knew it, the class had decided to have an Elizabethan feast.  Everyone brought something--including the Dry Sack.  One student proffered this cheesecake which, she said, might not have been Elizabethan, but which was very, very good.  It was.

Oven:  500ยบ

	5 cream cheese packages (8 ounces each)-NOT PHILADELPHIA BRAND
	1 3/4 cups sugar
	3 tablespoons flour
	1/2 teaspoons lemon peel
	1/2 teaspoons orange peel
	1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
	5 eggs
	2 egg yolks
	3/4 cup heavy cream
	1/2 cup sour cream
	1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs

Cream soft cream cheese with sugar, flour, lemon peel, orange peel, and vanilla.  Add eggs and yolks one at a time, blending well after each addition.  Add cream until thoroughly mixed.

Grease springform pan and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs.  Pour cheese filling into springform pan.  Pour water into a pan larger than the springform pan.  Place the springform pan in the pan with the water.  Carefully place in the oven.  Bake in pre-heated 500ยบ oven for 10 minutes and then at 250ยบ for 1 1/4 hours.
