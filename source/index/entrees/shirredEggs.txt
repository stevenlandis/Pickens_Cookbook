Shirred Eggs

@body
Preheat broiler in the oven.

	butter
	eggs
	milk or cream
	salt and pepper
	Swiss cheese, grated
	potato chip crumbs

Put 1/2 teaspoon butter in a muffin tin cup for each egg to be served.  Melt butter in the muffin tin cups over a stove-top burner.  When butter is melted, break 1 egg in each muffin tin cup on top of the melted butter.  Move muffin tin back over the stove burner and cook eggs until the white cooked part of the egg can clearly be seen from above.  Move the muffin tin around over the burner so all eggs cook to the same degree.

Remove muffin tin from burner.  Carefully pour about 1/2 teaspoon milk or cream onto the surface of each egg.  Add 1 tablespoon grated Swiss-type cheese over the surface of each egg.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle potato chip crumbs on top of the cheese.

Place the muffin tin with the prepared eggs under the broiler until the eggs are cooked and browned as desired.  Watch to insure uniform cooking.

Remove cooked eggs from the broiler, and with a knife or spoon, remove each cooked egg to a serving plate.

Tobasco, chopped peppers, chopped ham, or salsa may also be added as variations.

This is an easy way to fix eggs for a large crowd.
