The Old Original Bookbinder's Restaurant Cookbook

	1 cup split peas
	Hambone with some meat left on
	1/2 cup chopped onions
	1/2 cup chopped celery
	1/2 cup diced carrots
	1/2 cup diced green beans
	1 1/2 cup canned tomatoes
	Salt and pepper

Soak peas overnight in water to cover.  Drain.  Add ham bone and fresh water to cover and simmer, covered, for three hours.  Add remaining ingredients and continue cooking, covered, for an hour.  Remove ham bone and cut any meat on bone into bite-size pieces. We like to serve it at this point.  However, the soup can then be put through sieve or blender if you prefer.  

If the soup is too thick for your taste, add milk or cream to thin it.  If it is not thick enough, add a roux of butter and flour.  Season to taste.

I double the soup using a "package" of split peas.  Freezes well.
