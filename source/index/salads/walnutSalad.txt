PARMESAN WALNUT SALAD IN ENDIVE LEAVES

@body
Gourmet magazine, October 1995

	1 small garlic clove, minced and mashed to a paste with 1/2 t salt
	1 T mayonnaise
	2 T fresh lemon juice
	2 T olive oil
	1/4 pound Parmesan cheese chunk, sliced 1/8 inch thick and cut into 1/8 inch dice, about 1 cup
	1/2 cup finely chopped celery
	4 Belgian endives
	1 c walnuts, toasted lightly and chopped fine (Roll around in a hot skillet until they begin to smell good.)
	1/4 c finely chopped fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves

In a bowl whisk together garlic paste, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and oil.  Stir in Parmesan and celery.  Salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Trim endives and separate leaves.  Endive leaves may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped in dampened paper towels, in a plastic bag.

Stir walnuts and parsley into salad.  Dip wide end of each endive leaf into salad, scooping about 1 T of salad onto it.  (I think we use a teaspoon and filled.)  Makes about 40 hors d'oeuvres.
