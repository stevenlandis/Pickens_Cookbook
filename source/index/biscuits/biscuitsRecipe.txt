A World of Breads, Dolores Casella
 
Biscuits are a Midwestern tradition.  As we moved East, your dad and I were surprised that no one made biscuits nor were they readily available in restaurants.  McDonald's has changed that.  They were, however, the first food I learned to cook. 
 
I must have been about six or seven.  My mother would tie a large dish towel diagonally around my waist so one corner tucked into my collar while the other hung around my knees.  I remember feeling white and dusty as I studied the cookbook, a slim paperback from Spry.  The pages were dog-eared and spotted. 
 
By now, I know the recipe by heart and have seen it replicated in every cookbook.  Here, however, we give credit to the bread book we frequently use.
 
Preheat oven to 450º.
 

	2 cups flour
	3 teaspoons baking powder
	½ t. salt
	¼ cup shortening, butter, or margarine
	¾ cup milk (about)

 
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in shortening.  When the mixture is the consistency of coarse cornmeal, stir in milk, using enough so that the dough holds together and can be kneaded. Turn the dough onto a floured board and knead lightly, no more than 6 times.  Roll or pat out to a thickness of 1/2 to 3/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch rounds and bake on an ungreased cookie sheet in a 450º oven for 12 to 15 minutes.  Makes about 12 biscuits.
 
Work the dough just enough to hold together, no more, or the biscuits will be tough.  When cutting biscuits out, press cutter straight down without any twisting motion of the cutter.
