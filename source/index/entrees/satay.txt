Satay

@body
One of Daddy's interns, Baharudin Ben-Ali, was a grad student at Pitt from Malaysia.  When his wife Mahani joined him, the four of us often dined together.  Following is one of Mahani's recipes--and traditional fare in the Malay peninsula.  Satay is sold from street vendors like hot dogs.  Depending on the peppers, it has more of a kick than Nathan's.

Marinade:  
	1 pound beef or chicken, cut into small thin pieces
	1/4 cup lemon grass or lemon balm, chopped or pounded (or dried)
	1 tablespoon ginger, grated or pounded
	1/4 cup brown sugar
	1 teaspoon turmeric
	1 teaspoon cumin

Marinate the beef or chicken pieces in the seasonings above for 4 to 5 hours.  Remove and thread pieces on bamboo skewers.  Barbeque filled skewers over charcoal broiler, brushing skewers with oil before and during cooking.  

Sauce:  
	1 tablespoon paprika
	1 tablespoon sliced ginger root
	1/2 cup onions, diced
	1 teaspoon tamarind (kokani)
	1/2 cup ground peanuts or 1/4 cup peanut butter
	1/4 cup oil
	3 tablespoons brown sugar
	1 tablespoon coconut cream
	1/4 cup lemon grass or lemon balm, chopped
	1 tablespoon hot red pepper flakes, or equivalent whole dried red peppers.

Heat the oil in a pan.  Saut√© the onions and ginger until they begin to brown.  Add peppers, tamarind, and brown sugar.  Bring to boil.  Add rest of ingredients.  While stirring, simmer the mixture until it thickens.

Have the sauce ready to dip the filled skewers as they come off the grill.

If you can get them, Malaysian red peppers are as hot as any I've found.  You might want to experiment with the proportions in the sauce.
