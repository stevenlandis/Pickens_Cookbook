20-Fathoms Cook Book Tangier Style, E. Frank Dize

Oven:  375ยบ

The National Geographic article intrigued us, so Rusty and Roy Jett and your dad and I flew to Tangier Island for a weekend.  

We found roads the width of wide sidewalks--most people walked or biked; elegant deserted sandy beaches; people who closely resembled each other in speech and looks--fair skins and reddish hair; and wonderful, home-style cooking at the local.  

We cycled to the beach over a one-way rutted path through the salt marshes.  By the time Rusty fell off her bike the third time--we discovered she had a flat tire--she lay in the reeds giggling.  The company of good friends and the crab cakes and corn pudding made the adventure more than worthwhile.

	2 tablespoons corn starch
	1 large egg or 2 small eggs
	3/4 cup sugar
	2 tablespoons melted butter
	1 large can evaporated milk
	1 large can cream style corn (equal amount of fresh or frozen corn can be used)

Mix first three ingredients thoroughly.  Add milk and corn.  Mix again to blend.  Pour into 2" deep casserole baking dish and pour melted butter on top.  Bake at 375ยบ for 1 hour or until firm.
