I haven't tried this yet, but the name is very fascinating.

	1 package tortellini, cooked and drained
	1 package frozen green peas
	1 lemon, juiced
	2 garlic cloves, minced
	1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
	1/4 cup olive oil
	1 to 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated
	1 to 2 tablespoons wine vinegar
	1 to 2 tablespoons parsley

Pour water over the frozen peas to defrost and drain.  

In a large bowl, mix the tortellini, peas, minced garlic, and Parmesan cheese.  Blend the lemon juice, olive oil, and wine vinegar.  Pour over and mix with the tortellini mixture.

Transfer to a serving bowl, and sprinkle the surface with the parsley.
