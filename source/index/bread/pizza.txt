A World of Breads, Dolores Casella

Preheat oven to 400º.

	5 cups flour
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon black pepper, fresh ground
	1/4 cup oil (olive oil preferable)
	1 cake yeast
	1 1/4 cups warm water

Mix the dissolved yeast and the rest of the ingredients.  Knead the dough well, cover and let rise in oiled bowl until double in size.  Divide risen dough into 2 parts and stretch, roll, or throw the dough to fit each oiled pizza pan.  Spread with desired filling and bake immediately in a 400º oven until done, about 30 minutes or more, depending on the size of the pizza, and the filling.

FILLING.  My basis filling is a good, seasoned tomato sauce spread over the entire crust, except the edges.  On top of this, spread sautéed onions and peppers.  A layer of pepperoni, sliced thin, is essential.  Top all this with more tomato sauce.  Bake as directed, except 10 minutes before it is done, add a liberal topping of Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, grated, and melt into the pizza.  This way, the cheeses brown but do not burn.
