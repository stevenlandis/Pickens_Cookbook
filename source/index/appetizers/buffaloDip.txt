	Boneless chicken breasts
	Italian salad dressing
	8 oz. cream cheese
	8 oz. Ranch dressing
	6-8 oz. hot sauce (i.e., Crystal, not Tobasco)
	8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese
 
Marinate the chicken breasts in the Italian salad dressing and broil until cooked through.  Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. 
 
In a saucepan, mix together the cream cheese, Ranch dressing and hot sauce until melted.  Stir in the chicken cubes.  Pour the mixture into a greased casserole dish.  Sprinkle cheddar cheese on top.  Bake in a 350Â° oven until hot and bubbly, 20-30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and stir the cheddar cheese into the chicken mix.
 
Serve immediately with tortilla chips.
