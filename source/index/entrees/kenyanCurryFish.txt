Kenyan Curry And Fish

Florence Ojode

One of our several international “children,” Florence had worked with an IBM Selectric typewriter at an institute for insect research in Nairobi, Kenya, but she had never seen a dishwasher until she traveled through London on her way to the United States.  She had visited the seashore at Mombassa, but she had never been in the ocean until she discovered the Atlantic at Ocean City.  She cooked on an electric range at home, but she was mystified about the Garden State toolbooths—“How does the machine know you put in the right amount?”

Florence also discovered Silver Queen on the cob and shared with us several of her favorite Kenyan dishes.  Jambo, Florence.  

Preheat oven to 350º.

	1 cup tomato paste
	1/2 cup white vinegar
	1/2 teaspoon cardamom
	2 teaspoons turmeric
	2 teaspoons chili powder
	1/2 teaspoon cumin
	2 to 3 garlic cloves
	1/2 cup water

These are the ingredients for the curry.  Blend together and simmer for 20 minutes with the pan covered.

	3 onions, chopped
	white fish fillets as needed

Place the fish in the bottom of a greased pan or casserole.  In a skillet, heat oil and sauté the onions.  When translucent, remove and spread over the fish.  Add the curry on top of the onions.  Bake in a 350º oven for 45 minutes, covered.
