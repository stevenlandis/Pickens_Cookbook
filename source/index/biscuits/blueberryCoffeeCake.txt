A World of Breads, Dolores Casella
 
This recipe, blueberry jam, and blueberry pie are the prime uses of Claude Lynch's blueberries from Pemberton, New Jersey, Tru-Blu, that is.
 
Preheat oven to 375Â°.
 

	3/4 cup sugar
	1/3 cup butter
	2 large eggs
	1/3 cup milk
	2 cups flour
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 cups berries
	1/2 cup sugar
	1/3 cup flour
	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
	1/4 cup butter

 
Cream the 3/4 cup sugar and the 1/3 cup butter together and add the eggs.  Sift the 2 cups flour, the baking powder, and the salt and add alternately with the milk.  Stir in the berries.  Spread in a 9x12 inch pan, well buttered. 
 
Blend the 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, the cinnamon, and the 1/4 cup butter until crumbly.  Sprinkle on top of batter.  Bake in 375m oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  If blueberries are still frozen when mixed into the batter, the baking time may take an additional 15 minutes.  If thawed berries are used, they will tend to bleed their color through the batter, but this does not affect the flavor at all.
