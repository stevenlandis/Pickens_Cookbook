Barefoot in Paris, Ina Garten, 2004

Easy to make, colorful to serve, and tasty, too

Blanch 1 pound trimmed green beans 4 minutes in boiling water. Drain and chill in cold water at least 4 minutes. Drain and pat dry. If the beans are not to be used immediately, refrigerate, covered, until ready to prepare the rest of the dish.

Cut the following in large dice, about 1” pieces:
	1 red onion
	½ red pepper
	½ yellow pepper

In a small bowl, toss the onion and peppers with 2 T olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Heat oven to 425° degrees. Spread onions and peppers in a single layer on a baking sheet with a low rim. Roast for 15 minutes, tossing occasionally.

In a sauté pan heat 1-2 T of olive oil and toss the drained green beans to heat them through. Place the beans on a warmed platter and top with the roasted vegetables.

Serve hot or at room temperature.
