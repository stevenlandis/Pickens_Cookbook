	2 cups all-purpose flour
	3 tablespoons brown sugar
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1 teaspoon ground ginger
	½ teaspoon baking soda
	½ teaspoon salt
	½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
	¼ teaspoon ground cloves
	¼ cup cold butter or margarine
	1/3 cup molasses
	¼ cup milk
	1 egg, separated
	Sugar
 
In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, ginger, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, combine the molasses, milk and egg yolk until smooth; stir into the flour mixture just until moistened.  Turn out onto a floured surface; knead gently 6-8 times.  Pat into an 8-in. circle; cut into 12 wedges and place 1 inch apart on a greased baking sheet.  Beat egg white until frothy; brush over scones.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Bake at 400° for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.  Yield: 1 dozen.
