Dolores Casella: A World of Breads
 
This makes one big loaf which bakes diagonally on one of our cookie sheets. Divide and shape as needed for two smaller loaves.
 

	1 cake yeast
	 ¼ cup warm water
	2/3 cup scalded, cooled milk
	½ to 2/3 cup sugar
	½ teaspoon salt
	½ cup melted butter
	2 whole eggs
	2 egg yolks
	4 ½ to 5 cups flour or more
	1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
	1 cup golden raisins

 
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour the scalded milk over the sugar, salt, and butter. Let cool until lukewarm. Then stir in the yeast.
 
Add whole eggs, egg yolks, and about 2 ½ cups of the flour. Beat thoroughly. Stir in 2 more cups flour, lemon rind, and raisins. Turn dough out onto a floured breadboard, and stir in more flour, if necessary, to make a firm dough. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled.
 
Divide dough into 6 parts, 2 of the parts being smaller than the others. Roll each part into a long rope. Braid four of the ropes together and place on a buttered cookie sheet. Twist the 2 smaller ropes together and place over the braid. Let rise until almost doubled and then bake in a 350º oven for approximately 45 to 50 minutes.
 
Brush the braid with 1) mild or cream and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar and 2 tablespoons slivered, blanched almonds or 2) confectioners’ sugar icing thinned with water or orange juice and garnish with sprinkles.  For Easter, insert colored hard-boiled eggs into the braid before rising.
