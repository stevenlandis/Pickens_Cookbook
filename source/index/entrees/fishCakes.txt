A tasty way to make salmon patties or utilize left-over fish of most any type.

	1 can salmon or equal amount of pre-cooked fish.
	1 small onion, minced
	1 egg
	1/2 to 3/4 cup crushed soda crackers
	1/2 cup celery, minced
	1/4 cup green pepper, minced
	1/2 cup catsup
	salt and pepper

In a bowl, flake the fish.  Add all the other ingredients and mix well.  Add just enough catsup to make the mixture pliable enough to form a patty with your hands.  The patty should be about 3 inches in diameter and 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.  The patty should hold together when handled lightly.  If needed, add a few more crushed cracker crumbs to help firm up.  Use all the mixture to make the patties.  They may at this point be rolled in bread crumbs.

Heat a skillet, adding about 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 pat of margarine.  When heated, gently place the patties in the skillet.  Avoid crowding.  Cook the patties slowly over medium low heat until browned lightly.  Turn the patties over and brown on the other side.  Watch carefully, as they tend to burn quickly.  When done, remove and serve immediately.
