	1 head Napa cabbage (or other)
	3 Tablespoons minced onion
	3 Tablespoons butter
	3 Tablespoons flour
	½ cup milk
	½ cup chicken stock
	Parmesan cheese, grated

Cut cabbage into 1” squares

Sauté onion in wok or large pan with cover until softened in a little oil.  Add cabbage.  Stir well, cover and steam for 5 minutes.

In a small pan, melt butter.  Add flour.  Stir and cook until blended and not raw, about 3-5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Blend in milk and stock.  Add to cabbage mixture and stir well.  Add salt and pepper.  Transfer all to greased casserole.  Sprinkle liberally with parmesan or Romano cheese.  Bake in 350° oven until cheese begins to brown, 10-20 minutes.
