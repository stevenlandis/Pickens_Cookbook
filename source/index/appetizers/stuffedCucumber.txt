This makes a very good and interesting side dish.
 
	2/3 pound pork, ground or minced
	2 tablespoons cornstarch
	1/3 cup chicken broth
	1 tablespoon soy sauce
	1 tablespoon sherry
	3 to 4 medium sized cucumbers
	oil for cooking
 
Cut the unpeeled cucumbers into 1-inch rounds.  Scallop the top edge of each round with a sharp thin knife and also remove the seed core from each.  Discard the seeds and waste.
 
Mix the soy sauce, sherry, and chicken broth as a marinade, and mix in the pork.  After a few minutes, stuff the cored cucumber rounds with this mixture.  Pack well.
 
Heat oil for deep frying.  When hot, drop stuffed cucumber rounds into the oil for only a couple of minutes to seal.  Remove the rounds to a wok or hot skillet; cover and cook over medium heat until the pork is cooked.  It doesn't take as long as you may think, only a few minutes.  Remove and place on a plate and serve.
