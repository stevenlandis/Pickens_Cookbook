Broiled Clams and Oysters

@body
We first discovered these at a Rotary picnic on Long Beach Island.  They should not be overlooked.  The clams are excellent, but the oysters are spectacular.  Even your mother will eat them.
 
	Plenty of fresh clams and or oysters in the shell
	Minced garlic or garlic powder
	1/4 cup cornmeal for clams
 
Have a good bed of coals going on the BBQ grill.
 
Wash the shells.  Soak clams in clear water with the cornmeal mixed in to allow clams to clean themselves for 1 hour or more, if you can wait.  Oysters just have to have their shells scrubbed.
 
Open the shells and cut the meat from the shells as well as the muscles.  Put the loosened meat in the deepest half of each shell.
 
Put a piece of butter the size of a pea on each shell.  Add a few pieces of minced garlic or a pinch of garlic powder on top.
 
Carefully place each shell on the grill in order that none of the juice is lost.  “Broil only until the edges curl.”  Remove and slurp.
