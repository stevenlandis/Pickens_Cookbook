	3 1/2 cups flour
	1 teaspoon salt
	2 teaspoons soda
	2 tablespoons sugar
	5 large eggs
	1 quart buttermilk or sour milk
	1/4 cup melted butter
	1/2 cup wheat germ
 
Mix the dry ingredients, add the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter to the dry ingredients, and stir in the wheat germ last.  Bake on a lightly buttered hot griddle.
 
Other flours may be substituted for the wheat germ, or left out entirely.  Crumbled bacon, about 1 cup blueberries or other chopped fruit, sliced hotdogs, minced onions, or oysters may be added by choice.
