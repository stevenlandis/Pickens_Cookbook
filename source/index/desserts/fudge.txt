Fudge

Edith Steiner

	4 cups white sugar
	1 can evaporated milk
	1/4 pound butter or margarine
	2 packages of chocolate chips or 1 large
	1 pint marshmallow cream
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1/2 to 1 cup pecans, chopped

In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, milk, and butter, and cook to soft ball stage, stirring constantly.  To test for soft ball, put some cold water in a bowl.  Let a few drops of the hot candy fall into the cold water.  If it disintegrates, it is not ready.  If you can roll it into a little soft ball with your finger, it has reached soft ball stage.

Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the ingredients.  Mix candy well but quickly.

Pour hot fudge into a buttered cake pan and chill.  Cut into pieces when fudge is cool.
