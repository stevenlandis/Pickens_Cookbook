Ham Spread

@body
The night before we took off for a summer vacation, Daddy and I cleaned out the refrigerator, and he concocted ham spread which we slathered on Nova Scotia bread for sandwiches for the trip.  A few carrot sticks and a sack of chocolate chip cookies, and we had lunch for the next day.

There we were on the way to Kansas or Michigan or Ohioâ€”heading west on Route 70.  We stopped at a roadside rest area and tore into lunch.  Maybe we were hungry.  All I know is that ham spread on Nova Scotia bread has been a family favorite ever since.

	6 to 8 cups ground ham
	1/2 to 3/4 cup mayonnaise
	1 tablespoon yellow mustard
	1/2 cup pickle relish

Roast ham--whole, butt, or shank portion--in a charcoal oven over a slow heat until it is browned nicely and has absorbed a good flavor, about 1 to 1/2 hours.  Remove and let cool.  Trim out the bone, leaving some meat on the bones for soups.  Depending on the ham, there should be at least 1 or 2 ham steaks to be cut off for other meals, even on a shank portion ham.  The rest of the ham meat, or as much as you want, should be ground in a grinder or chopped in a Cuisinart to a fairly fine consistency to give you what is needed to make ham spread.

Add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup mayonnaise to the ground ham, but just enough to act as a binder.  Mix well.  Add about 1/2 cup pickle relish and 1 tablespoon yellow mustard (no substitutions).  Mix well.  Taste, and adjust ingredients as desired.  There is great variation on the taste and texture of ham.

Ham spread on Nova Scotia bread is classic!
