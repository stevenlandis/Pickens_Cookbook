Turkey Wraps With CURRY-CHUTNEY MAYONNAISE and PEANUTS

Bon Appétit, November 2004

We don’t wait for leftover turkey to make these. We plan for them. We use about a tablespoon of Hellman’s low-fat mayonnaise for each tortilla and mix the amount well with the mango chutney. Any proportion tastes great, so feel free to vary the measure. We have always used broccoli slaw, too, because it was available in bagged form the first time we tried this and we liked the result. We have also peeled broccoli stems and julienned them in the Benriner (mandoline) which works fine—but the bagged mix is so easy to buy and use.

Makes 4

	1 cup mayonnaise
	¼ cup mango chutney
	1 ½  t curry powder, preferably Madras-style
	Four  9- to 10-inch-diameter spinach flour tortillas or plain flour tortillas
	1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
	6 T coarsely chopped lightly salted peanuts, divided
	1 ½ cup coleslaw mix, preferably green and red cabbage with carrots, or broccoli slaw, without dressing

Mix mayonnaise, chutney, and curry powder in small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

Spread 2 T curry-chutney mayonnaise in 2-inch-wide strip down center of 1 tortilla. Top with ½ cup turkey, ¼ cup cilantro, 1 ½ T peanuts, and 1/3 cup coleslaw mix. Fold sides of tortilla over both ends of filling and roll from one remaining side to the other to make the wrap. Slice diagonally in half to serve. 

You can also fold the sides of the tortilla over one end of the filling and roll from one remaining side to the other to make one large wrap with an open end.
