Baked Whitefish

@body
This recipe came from instructions for cooking on the cedar plank Rusty and Roy sent us a number of years ago.  Works well without the plank too.

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.  Mix equal parts Dijon mustard and mayonnaise and season with tarragon.  We prefer using cod or scrod, but any whitefish fillet will work well.  Lightly oil the baking pan.  Place the fish in the pan, pretty side up.  Cover the top of the fish with the mixture and cover well.  Bake for about 30 minutes or until fish flakes.

For the two of us, I use about 2 tablespoons of mustard and mayo each and mix well with 1 teaspoon tarragon.
