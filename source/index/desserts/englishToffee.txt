English Toffee

One of the candies we always ask Daddy to make at Christmas.

	1 cup sugar
	1/2 pound butter or margarine
	3 tablespoons water
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	3 small Hershey bars
	3/4 cup pecans

Place first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium low heat until light brown.  Stir constantly.  Test candy and cook to hard crack stage.  Be patient, it takes time to get it right.  You can actually see the changes in the mixture.  If you wonder if it is done, just stir and cook it some more, as long as it does not get dark brown.

Pour the cooked toffee into a buttered pie pan.  Immediately lay the chocolate bars, in pieces, on top of the hot toffee and spread the chocolate across the surface, if necessary.  Sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate.  Quickly, while the toffee is still fluid, press the nuts gently down with a spoon or spatula.  Set aside to cool.  When cooled, cut or break into bite sized pieces.
