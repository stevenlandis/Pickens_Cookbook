Chicken Bouillabase

@body
	1 chicken, cut in pieces
	3 cups onion, chopped
	3/4 cup leeks, cut in small rounds
	4 cups tomato (seeded, drained, and chopped)
	1/4 cup tomato sauce
	5 to 6 garlic cloves, chopped
	1 orange peel
	1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
	1 teaspoon thyme
	2 to 3 bay leaves
	Pinch of saffron
	Salt and pepper
	2 cups white wine
	rice

Sweat the chicken pieces by putting them in a skillet with a little hot oil or olive oil for about 10 minutes with the lid on over medium heat.  Set aside.

In a Dutch oven or heavy pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil or so and saut√© the onions and leeks, and garlic.  When translucent, add the other ingredients, plus the white wine and the chicken.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes or until done.

Serve chicken bouillabaisse over rice and the following sauce:

	1 clove garlic per person
	1 teaspoon salt, pounded or blended with the garlic
	1 tablespoon basin or oregano
	Diced pimento
	1/3 cup bread crumbs
	1 egg yolk

The easy method to make the sauce is to put the sauce ingredients in a blender, and slowly add oil to liquefy the sauce to make it spreadable.  Don't forget to add a hot pepper or hot pepper flakes.
