A World of Breads, Dolores Casella

	3 cups water
	1 tablespoon salt
	2 tablespoons sugar
	1/3 cup butter
	11 cups flour, sifted
	2 cakes or 2 packages yeast
	1/3 cup warm water
	1 cup water

In a saucepan combine the first 4 ingredients.  Bring to a boil and then cool.  Sift the flour into a large bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in the 1/3 cup warm water.  When dissolved, stir the yeast mixture and the 1 cup water into the flour.  Add the cooled water-sugar mixture.  Mix well until the dough no longer sticks to the hands.  

Knead on floured board if necessary.  The dough should be worked about 10 minutes.  At this point the Portuguese sprinkle the dough lightly with more flour, and make the sign of the cross on the dough with the side of the hand.  Delores Casella rubs the dough with softened butter.  Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/4 hours.

When the dough has doubled, punch it down and divide into 3 parts.  Grease three 9” layer-cake pans, and place the dough in the pans.  Cover and let rise again until doubled, about 1 hour.  When ready to bake, cut into the top of each loaf lightly with a sharp knife, to make the sign of the cross.  Bake at 450º for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 350º, and continue baking until browned and done, about another 35 to 45 minutes.  Check occasionally while baking.  If bread is getting too brown, cover loosely with foil tent.

When the bread is done, gently remove the loaves from the pans and let them cool on cooling rack.

Regular bread loaf pans may be used in place of cake pans.
