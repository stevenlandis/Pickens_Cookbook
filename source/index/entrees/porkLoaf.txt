We have served this at New Year's brunches in loaf or ring form.  The mustard/mayonnaise looks pretty in a silver bowl in the middle of the circle.

Preheat oven to 350º.

	1 pound ground beef
	1 pound ground lean pork
	3/4 cup cracker crumbs or bread
	1/4 cup onion
	2 eggs
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1 cup milk
	1 tablespoon parsley

Mix all ingredients thoroughly.  Place mixture in a greased loaf pan in a 350° oven and bake for 1 1/2 hours, using glaze application every 30 minutes.

Glaze:
	1 cup brown sugar
	1/4 cup cider vinegar
	3/4 tablespoon dry mustard

Put in a pan all glaze ingredients, stir and bring to a boil until dissolved and blended.  Baste ham loaf as directed.

Serving Sauce:
	1/2 cup heavy cream
	1/2 cup mayonnaise
	1/4 cup mustard
	2 tablespoons horseradish
	1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
	dash of salt

Blend all serving sauce ingredients together.  Serve with cooked ham.
