Preheat oven to 300ยบ.

	12 ounces walnuts, coarsely ground
	12 ounces almonds, coarsely ground
	2 ounces sugar
	1 teaspoon cinnamon
	2 pounds phyllo pastry sheets at room temperature
	2 pounds butter, melted

Combine nuts, sugar, and cinnamon.

Butter a 12 inch x 18 inch sheet pan, with edges.  Place 2 pastry sheets in the center and brush with butter.  Repeat, buttering each layer until pile is 1 inch high (1 pound of sheets).  

Spread 1 1/2 quarts of the nut mixture evenly over the pastry.  Add another 1 inch layer of the buttered pastry sheets.  Butter the top sheet.  Cut diagonally to make 1 1/4 inch diamond shapes.  Bake in a 300ยบ oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the pastry is golden brown.  Remove the pastry from the oven.  Pour the cooked sauce over the baklava and let stand before eating.

Sauce:
	1 pound 12 ounces sugar
	2 cups honey
	2 tablespoons lemon juice

Combine the sugar, honey, and lemon juice in a heavy bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a boil stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Set aside until baklava is baked.

Put each piece of cut baklava in a cupcake paper cup with the sauce.  This helps in serving because it does get sticky.
