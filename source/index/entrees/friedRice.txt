Fried Rice

This is a less Americanized version.  For any fried rice, the rice must be cooked at least one day in advance.  This is very important; otherwise it will stick very badly when fried. This traditional fried rice uses no soy sauce--if you are a purist. 

	6 cups cooked rice, cold
	1/2 pound uncooked medium or large shrimp. (not canned) (For a main dish, double the quantity)
	1/4 pound bacon, 1/2 inch pieces, or ham
	1/2 ounce Chinese roast pork, slivered for garnish (optional)
	3 eggs
	1 slice ginger
	1/4 cup oyster sauce
	1/4 cup frozen peas
	1/2 cup scallions
	splash of sherry

Heat wok and add 1 tablespoon oil.  Beat the eggs and add to hot wok, turning wok so that eggs spread out as thin as possible and cook quickly.  Do not cook the eggs hard.  Roll up cooked egg in wok, remove and cut into "noodles".  Shake apart and reserve.

Fry bacon pieces in wok.  Cook until done but not hard crisp.  Add the slice of ginger and the shrimp.  Stir fry quickly over high heat but do not overcook.  Empty the contents of the wok to a bowl.  Remove the ginger slice.

Add a little oil to the wok.  When hot, add the rice and stir fry for a few seconds.  Cover the wok with a lid and steam the rice to heat.  Add the oyster sauce and mix with the rice.  Then add the shrimp and frozen peas.  Stir the mixture.  Add a little salt if desired.  Add the bacon and the eggs.  Stir over heat to mix.  Remove the fried rice to a bowl or platter.  Sprinkle the top with the roast pork slivers and scallions and serve immediately.
