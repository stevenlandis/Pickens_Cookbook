Vada Mack Melgren

Aunt Vada gave us this recipe in 1978.

	1/2 cup sugar
	1 teaspoon dry mustard
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 tablespoon celery seed
	1/4 cup onion, grated or minced
	1/3 cup vinegar
	1 cup vegetable oil

Mix the dry ingredients, except the celery seeds, with the sugar in a bowl.  Stir in the onion and any juice from it and part of the vinegar.  Stirring constantly, add the remaining vinegar and gradually add the oil.  Finally, stir in the celery seed.

Chill and serve over or with any fresh fruit or combination of fruits.
