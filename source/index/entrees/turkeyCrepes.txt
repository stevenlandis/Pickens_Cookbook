Crêpes Batter
Makes 12 crêpes, 6” to 6½” in diameter.
	1 c. cold water
	1 c. cold milk
	2 c. sifted all purpose flour
	4 Tb melted butter
	4 eggs
	½ t. salt

Gradually blend eggs into flour, beat in liquid by spoonfuls, then the butter and strain batter to get rid of lumps.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Remove pan from heat and pour about ¼ cup into center and tilt pan to cover it.  Heat for 60-80 seconds, flip for 30 seconds.

Sauce
	2 Tb butter
	2 ½ Tb. Flour
	1 c. boiling milk
	1 c. boiling stock
	1 t. salt 
	1 t. pepper
	1 egg yolk
	¼ c. whipping cream
	¼ c. grated Swiss cheese

Make a roux, beat in the milk, stock and seasoning.  Bring to a boil for one minute.  Beat in the egg yolk and cream by the tablespoon.  Return to the heat, boil until very thick.  Fold in the turkey mixture and cheese.

Check seasoning.  We’ve served them individually: spoon filling into crepes and wrap like burritos.  For larger groups, you can stack them like a Napoleon and cut in wedges to serve.  Reheat in a 350° oven until warm.
