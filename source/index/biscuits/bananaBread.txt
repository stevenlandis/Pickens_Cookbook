Banana Bread

Mrs. Martin
 
The Martins lived next door when I was a little girl.  They had two daughters.  Teresa was a little older than I, and Betty Anne was several years younger.  They also had a living room full of rocking chairs, a huge lilac in the back yard, and a gleaming kitchen.  One day Mrs. Martin told me how she kept it so spotless.  "Every time I spill something, I just take a paper towel--like this--and wipe it right up.  This stove looks like the day Abe and I bought it."  And it did.  I loved her banana bread when I was a girl, and it has continued to be a family favorite.
 

	2/3 cup sugar
	1/3 cups soft shortening
	2 eggs
	3 tablespoons sour milk
	1 cup mashed bananas
	2 cups sifted flour
	1 teaspoon baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon soda
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 cup chopped nuts

 
Stir 1/2 teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice into 3 tablespoons milk and set it aside. 
 
Preheat oven to 350Â°.  Cream sugar and shortening until fluffy.  Add two eggs and beat until well mixed.  Stir mashed bananas into the mixture.
 
Measure the flour into a bowl.  Stir in the baking powder, soda, and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the banana mixture, alternating with the sour milk.  Stir in chopped nuts.
 
You can also make start this in a food processor where you can mix the sugar, shortening, eggs, and bananas before removing and adding dry ingredients.
 
Pour into one greased loaf pan and bake 50 to 60 minutes.
 
Test to see if it is done by piercing the middle with a piece of spaghetti.  If it comes out clean, the bread is ready to remove from the oven.
 
Gently shake it from its pan onto a cooling rack.
