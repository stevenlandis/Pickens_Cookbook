Berry Jam

@body
Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries--almost any berry becomes jam in much the same way.  The best berries to use are those you just picked.  They should also be just ripe when the pectin and sugar contents are highest.  Include a few that are less ripe, too.  They help bring out the flavor.

	4 cups berries
	3 cups sugar

Gently rinse the berries, removing any stems, bad berries, and other debris.  Drain.

Measure 4 cups berries into a large, heavy porcelain or stainless pan.  Be sure it is a large pan, because jam bubbles dramatically.

Place the pan over low heat until the berries begin to juice.  Sprinkle the sugar over the berries, but do not stir.

When the sugar begins to dissolve well, stir gently.  When the sugar is entirely dissolved, stir once more and turn up the heat to high.

Depending on the pectin level, the jam boils for 5 to 20 minutes.  At first the bubbles are big and light colored.  Some berries generate a lot of foam which you can skim off and remove.

When the jam nears the end of the cooking time, the bubbles are thicker and darker.  Begin testing after 5 minutes.  Drop a few drops on a plate to see if it runs slowly or stays in place after a few moments.  It's better to cook it less than more.

When you put the berries on to juice, prepare the jars as described in the APPLE BUTTER recipe.  You can use smaller jars, of course, like baby food or pickle relish jars--any with non-plastic, sealable lids.

You can also seal the jars with paraffin.  Melt paraffin in a coffee can over very low heat.  Dribble a thin layer over the hot jam in a sterile jar.  When the first thin layer sets, add another thin layer to fill in completely because paraffin tends to shrink and pull away from the sides as it cools.  Add another thin layer if necessary.
