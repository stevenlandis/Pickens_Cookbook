Lilian's Salad

Lilian Nakasata, Monroeville, Pennsylvania

It was with Lilian and Sue Nakasata that we learned to prepare shrimp chips and to eat barbecued chicken with chopsticks.  Lilian often served this salad as a complement to spicy meals.

	2 packages lemon Jell-O (3 ounce size)
	1 cup hot water
	1 cup juice from 2 mandarin orange cans
	2 teaspoons lemon juice
	1 large can frozen orange juice-no water added
	2 can mandarin oranges, drained
	1 3 ounce package cream cheese

Open and drain the juice from 2 cans of mandarin oranges.  Reserve the juice.  

Dissolve the lemon Jell-O in the boiling water.  Add all the other ingredients, except the orange slices.  Stir well.  When blended, add the orange slices.  Pour into container of your choice.  Chill thoroughly.  Serve on lettuce leaves.
