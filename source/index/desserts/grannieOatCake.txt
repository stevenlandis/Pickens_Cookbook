Grannie's Oat Cakes

Mrs. Timmons, Nova Scotia

We drove around the Cabot Trail one day from our campground in Broad Cove.  When we reached what must have been the point furthest east into the Atlantic, we also needed gasoline.  Fortunately we found a gas station and, across the road, a house with the familiar "Baked Goods" sign.  Daddy bought gas; I picked up a loaf of bread, a beautiful apple pie with crumb topping, and a bag of cookies called oat cakes.  The cookies were fresh from the oven, and they disappeared quickly.  Before the end of the day, someone had dropped a knee in the pie, but it didn't deter us from enjoying it for evening dessert.

When we came home, we looked everywhere, without success, for an oat cake recipe.  About six months later, all the gasoline charges had come in, and I found the receipt for that remote station on the Cabot Trail.  I wrote to the address and asked the reader to contact the woman who lived across the highway and ask her to send me the oat cake recipe.  

Mrs. Timmons' letter began:  "Dear Friend."

	3 cups rolled oats
	3 cups flour
	1 cup white sugar
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon soda
	1 1/2 cups lard (shortening works but not as well)
	3/4 cup cold water

Combine oats, flour, sugar, salt, soda.  Work in lard as for pastry.  Moisten with water.  Cover surface on which dough will be rolled with thin layer of oats.  Roll dough out about 3/8 inch thick with oats on both top and bottom of dough.  Cut rolled dough into 1 1/2 inch squares. (I use a pizza cutter.)  Bake in preheated oven at 350Â° about 15 minutes on a cookie sheet.  If a cookie sheet with raised edges is used, roll out the dough on the cookie sheet and cut into pieces in place.
