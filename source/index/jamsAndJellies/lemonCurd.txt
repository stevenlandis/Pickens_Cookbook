Lemon Curd

All About Cookery, Mrs. Beeton

	3 eggs
	3 ounces butter
	1 cup sugar
	3 lemons, juice and rind

Whisk the eggs and put into a double-boiler with the sugar, finely-grated lemon rind (no white), and the lemon juice. Cook over boiling water. Stir with a whisk until the mixture is thick and smooth. When the whisk leaves "lines" on the surface, the curd is done. Pour into clean, sterile jars, and seal. You may also pour into clean containers, cover, and refrigerate.
