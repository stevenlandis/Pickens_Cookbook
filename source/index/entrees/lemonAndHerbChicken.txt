The Silver Palate Cookbook

	1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, dill and parsley in about equal proportions, or to taste
	2 cloves garlic, minced
	3 boned chicken breasts, skinned and halved, about 2 1/4 pounds altogether salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	1 big lemon
	2 tablespoons sweet butter

Preheat oven to 350Â° F.

Mix herbs and garlic together in a small bowl. Flatten chicken breasts by pressing them gently against the work surface with the palm of your hand.  Arrange breast pieces on foil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle herb and garlic mixture over chicken breasts.
Slice lemons and arrange 2 or 3 slices over each breast. Dot with butter and seal the packets. Set on a baking sheet.

Set pan in the middle of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Transfer to serving plates and allow guests to open packets at table.
