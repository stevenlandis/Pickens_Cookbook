This traditional Kentucky recipe has become a Pickens' traditional Christmas dessert.

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

Cake:
	1 cup butter
	2 cups sugar
	5 eggs, beaten
	1 cup buttermilk
	1 cup jam, homemade blackberry recommended
	3 cups flour
	1 teaspoon soda
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
	1 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
	1 1/2 teaspoon allspice

Icing:
	1 cup cream
	1 stick margarine
	2 cups brown sugar

Cream the butter and sugar.  Add the eggs, one at a time, and blend well.  Stir the jam in the batter.

Sift the spices with the flour.  Add about 1/3 of the flour mixture to the batter, alternating with 1/3 of the buttermilk.   Stir each time just until blended.

Butter and flour 3, 9-inch round cake pans.  Pour the batter equally among the 3 pans.  Bake in a 350ยบ oven for about 30 minutes, or until done.  Test before removing from oven.  Remove immediately from pans and let cool on rack.

Blend and cook the cream, margarine, and brown sugar for the icing.  Stir constantly and cook to soft ball stage.  Cool slightly.  Beat well.  Spread between the layers and on the top of the 3-layer cake.  

Commercial blackberry or raspberry jams can be used, but homemade works best.  Frozen berries can be used to make the jam.  It's work, but so-so-so good.
