Bon Appétit  April 2004

Makes 24

	2 sheets frozen puff pastry (one 17.3-ounce package), thawed, each sheet cut into 12 squares
	1 large egg beaten to blend with 1 tablespoon water (for glaze)
	4 3.5-ounce bars imported good quality bittersweet or milk chocolate, each cut into six 2 x ¾-inch pieces
	sugar

Line baking sheet with parchment paper.  Brush top of each puff pastry square with egg glaze.  Place 1 chocolate piece on edge of 1 pastry square.  Roll up dough tightly, enclosing chocolate.  Repeat with remaining pastry and chocolate.  Place pastry rolls on baking sheet, seam side down.  Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover pastries with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Cover and refrigerate remaining egg glaze.

Preheat oven to 400º F.  Brush tops of pastry rolls with remaining egg glaze.  Sprinkle lightly with sugar.  Bake until pastries are golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

We have found these quick, easy, and great for potluck occasions.  They also taste great.
