Swiss Fondue

@body
This fondue is very special when served with a tossed salad, Polish vodka, and Ina and Don Spenser.  It was a Kennywood Day in Monroeville, and Ina and Don invited us for supper and bridge while we awaited your return.  We dipped and talked and dipped and talked . . . .  We never did play bridge.  Serve the cold vodka in small glasses, spear a piece of bread, dip in the vodka, and then into the fondue.  It can't get much better.

	1 pound Switzerland cheese (Emmenthal or Gruyere)
	2 tablespoons flour
	1 clove garlic
	2 cups dry white wine
	3 tablespoons Kirsch
	pinch of nutmeg
	salt and pepper to taste
	Italian or French bread

Shred the cheese and dredge with the flour.  Rub a heavy casserole or fondue pot with 1 cut clove of garlic.  Pour in the wine, heat until bubbles begin to rise.  Add the cheese, stirring with a wooden spoon until melted.  Add the Kirsch, nutmeg, salt and pepper.

Keep the fondue hot, but not boiling.  If it is too thick, thin with more wine, 1 tablespoon at a time.  

Serve with bite-sized pieces of crusty bread, cut and toasted lightly in a hot oven.
