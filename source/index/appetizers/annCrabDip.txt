Most measurements are absent since Ann long-ago discovered cooking by sight and taste.  The ingredients are all good, so keep trying until you get to the mixture you like best.
 
	8 oz. cream cheese, softened
	1 can crab meat, at least 7.5 oz, more if you like more
	Shredded cheddar cheese to taste
	Old Bay seasoning
	Lemon juice
	Worcestershire sauce
	Salt and pepper
	Mayonnaise or sour cream
 
Mix the cream cheese until soft and creamy.  Stir in the crab meat.  Add cheese, to taste.  Mix in Old Bay seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in a few tablespoons of mayonnaise or sour cream, or both, until the mixture loosens up and can be spread.   
 
Spread into a greased casserole.  Bake in a 350Â° oven for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
 
Serve with slices of warm crusty baguette.
