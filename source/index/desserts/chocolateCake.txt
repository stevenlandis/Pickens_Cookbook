Chocolate Cake

The Red Balloon, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania

At Lower Merion High School, Ann could choose a semester work experience to give her an opportunity to explore potential careers.  Since she was interested in cooking, she opted to work at the Red Balloon, a French restaurant in Bryn Mawr.

Ann came home one day and said she'd be glad to manage a food service, but she didn't want to cook in a restaurant kitchen the rest of her life.  Shortly after she finished her stint, the restaurant itself folded.  Fortunately Ann worked there when she did because we are still enjoying some of the chef's recipes which you'll find scattered throughout this volume.

Preheat oven to 375ยบ.

	3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
	1/2 cup boiling water
	3/4 cup butter
	2 teaspoons vanilla
	1 cup sugar
	2/3 cup brown sugar
	3 eggs
	1 cup sour cream
	2 cups flour
	1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	1 teaspoon soda
	1/2 teaspoon salt

Melt the chocolate in the boiling water.  Cream the butter, vanilla, and sugars.  Add and beat in the eggs and sour cream.  Add the cooled water and chocolate.  Sift the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt.  Add to the cake mixture and blend well.

Pour batter into greased cake pans coated lightly with bread crumbs.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven for about 35 minutes.  Test.  Remove and decorate when cooled.
