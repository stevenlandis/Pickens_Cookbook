Veal Parmesan

@body
Preheat oven to 350°.

	6 or 8 pieces of veal (venison works, too)
	1 egg
	1 teaspoons water
	1 egg
	1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
	1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
	1/4 oil
	1 onion, minced
	1 small can tomato paste
	2 cups hot water
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon marjoram
	1/2 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded

Sprinkle the veal with salt and pepper.  Beat the egg with the teaspoon water.  In another bowl, blend the Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.  Dip the veal pieces in this mixture to coat completely.

In a large pan or skillet, heat the oil and sauté the veal until browned on both sides.  Remove to a shallow baking pan large enough to hold the meat in 1 layer.

Sauté the minced onion in the same skillet.  Then add the tomato paste, 2 cups water, salt and marjoram.  When heated and blended, pour this mixture over the veal.  Top with the grated cheese.  Bake in the 350 oven for about 30 minutes.
