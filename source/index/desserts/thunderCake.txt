Thunder Cake

When he was about 4, one day Steven Landis and I checked out several books from the San Jose Library including Thunder Cake, by Patricia Polacco. It’s a great story about a little girl whose grandmother distracts her from an approaching storm by taking her around the farm to collect ingredients to make a cake. Of course Steven and I had to try it. After all, who doesn’t put tomatoes in chocolate cakes?
Pre-heat oven to 350º. 
Cream together one at a time:
	1 cup shortening 
	1 ¾  cup sugar 
	1 teaspoon vanilla 
	3 eggs, separated 

Blend yolks in. Beat whites until they are stiff.  Then fold in the whites. 
	1 cup cold water 
	1/3 cup pureed tomatoes 
	Sift together: 
	2 ½ cups cake flour 
	½ cup dry cocoa 
	1 ½  teaspoons baking soda 
	1 teaspoon salt 
Mix dry mixture into creamy mixture. Bake in two greased and floured 8 ½-inch pans at 350º for 35 to 40 minutes. Frost with chocolate butter frosting. Top with strawberries.
