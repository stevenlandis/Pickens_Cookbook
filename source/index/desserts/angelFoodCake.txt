Angel Food Cake

@body
In the "good old days" when you were growing up, egg yolks were one of babies' first foods.  I would separate the eggs, dropping the whites into a jar I kept covered in the refrigerator, and poaching the yolks for your meals.  Each of you had an egg yolk a day--and your dad and I and our guests ate a number of angel food cakes.  

Preheat oven to 375º.

	1 1/2 cup egg whites, separated
	1 1/2 tablespoons cream of tartar
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1/4 teaspoon almond extract
	1 3/4 cups sifted sugar
	1 cup cake flour


Sift flour and 3/4 cup sugar together twice.  Beat egg whites until frothy; then add cream of tartar and salt.  Continue beating until soft peaks develop.  Add the 1 cup sugar by 2 tablespoons at a time.  Beat with a wire whisk.  Gradually blend in rest of flour and sugar until the peaks hold their shape well.

Rinse a large tube pan with cold water; shake out.  Pour the batter in pan, and twist pan to remove large air bubbles.

Bake in 375° oven for 35 minutes.  Test.  Invert on cooling rack for about 1 hour or until cooled.  To remove from pan, run a long, thin knife around the edge of the pan.  Remove outside of tube pan.  Run the knife around the bottom to loosen for removal.

Eat plain or put on icing or sauce as desired.
