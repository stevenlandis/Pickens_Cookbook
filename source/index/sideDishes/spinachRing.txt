Preheat oven to 350°.

	Prepare 1 cup standard white sauce.
	1/4 pound sharp cheddar cheese, grated
	1 large onion, minced
	Salt and pepper
	3 egg yolks
	3 egg whites, beaten stiff
	1 package frozen spinach, chopped
	1 to 2 cups cooked buttered carrot sticks

Melt the cheese in the white sauce. Remove from heat.  Add the onion, egg yolks well blended, salt and pepper to taste.  Stir.  Squeeze the spinach in a paper towel to remove excess moisture.  Add to mixture.  Fold in beaten egg whites.

Grease a ring mold well.  Pour in spinach mixture.  Bake in 350° oven until set and slightly brown.

Serve with cooked carrots in the center.
