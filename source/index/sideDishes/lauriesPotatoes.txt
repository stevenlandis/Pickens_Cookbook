Laurie's Potatoes

@body
From Ann and Albert’s friend Laurie Conley.  It can be scaled to feed any size group

	5 lbs. potatoes (variety of your choice)
	1 stick butter
	Minced garlic
	Diced red pepper
	Minced rosemary
	Diced onion or onion flakes
	Salt and pepper.

Cube the potatoes with their skins on.  Parboil the potatoes until fork tender and drain.

Melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove top.  Add the garlic, diced red pepper, rosemary, onion and salt and pepper.  

Mix together the potatoes and butter.  Put into a greased casserole dish.  May be made ahead and refrigerated.  

Heat potatoes in a 350° oven for 30-45 minutes.  Broil a few minutes until crispy on top.
