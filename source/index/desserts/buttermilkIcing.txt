Buttermilk Icing

Edith Steiner

	2 cups sugar
	1 cup buttermilk
	2 tablespoons Karo syrup, clear or dark
	1 teaspoon soda
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1 tablespoon butter

Mix all the ingredients and boil to soft ball stage.  Spread the icing.  If icing is too thick, add a little milk and beat well.

Mom’s recipe also says to add nuts because it makes a “yummy” candy.
