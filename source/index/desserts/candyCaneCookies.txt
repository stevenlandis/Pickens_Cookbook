Mary’s favorite Christmas cookie.

	1 cup confectioner’s sugar
	1 egg
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	½ teaspoon almond extract
	3-1/2 cup sifted flour
	1 teaspoon salt
	red food coloring
	1 egg white

Cream butter and sugar.  Add egg and extracts.  Beat until fluffy.  Blend in flour and salt.  Set half of the dough aside.  Tint the other half red.  Roll 1 teaspoon white dough into 4” strip.  Roll 1 teaspoon red dough into 4” strip. Place side by side, twist and curve one end like a candy cane.  Brush with egg white and sprinkle with red sugar on ungreased sheet.  Don’t get egg white on the sheet.

Bake at 350°, 10-12 minutes. Cool a few minutes on the sheet and remove to cooling racks.
