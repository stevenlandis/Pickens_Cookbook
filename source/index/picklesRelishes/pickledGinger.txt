Pickled Ginger

@body
This is a necessary recipe to have if you serve Chinese food. For a long time we could not find it or buy it. Finding the recipe in Gourmet or Bon Appétit solved the problem.

	2 cups fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
	½ cup sugar
	¾ cup rice vinegar
	1 t salt
	Red food color

Cover prepared ginger with water.  Boil for 2 minutes.  Drain ginger.
Heat sugar, rice vinegar, and salt to dissolve.  When dissolved, pour over drained ginger.  Refrigerate for 3 to 4 days before using.  Store in refrigerator.  Keeps a long time.
