Edith Steiner

	3 cups vanilla wafers, ground
	1 cup nuts, ground
	1 cup powdered sugar
	1/2 cup bourbon

Mix all ingredients together and blend well.  Form dough into balls the size of a walnut, about 1 inch in diameter.  Roll each ball in powdered sugar to coat.

Let the balls rest in a closed container overnight to let the flavor blend.
