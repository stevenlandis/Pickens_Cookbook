10 to 12 servings

	5 T olive oil divided
	1 ½ C chopped onion
	1 C chopped red bell pepper
	3 garlic cloves, chopped
	1 ¼ lbs. coarsely ground or chopped lamb
	1 C chopped plum tomatoes
	3 T tomato paste
	1 T fresh lemon juice
	¾ t ground cumin
	½ t cayenne powder
	¼ t ground allspice
	½ C chopped fresh parsley
	6 T chopped fresh mint
	7 6-to 7-inch-diameter pita breads
	7 T tahini

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Sauté until onion is translucent. Add lamb. Increase heat to medium-high; sauté until lamb is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add next 6 ingredients. Cook until mixture begins to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Mix in parsley and mint. Cook until thick, about 3 minutes longer. Season lamb filling with salt and pepper.

Insert small knife into edge of 1 pita; cut halfway around bread. Open bread. Spread ½ cup lamb filling in bread, then 1 tablespoon tahini. Brush both sides of filled bread with oil. 

Preheat oven to 250° F. Place baking sheet in oven over medium heat. Add 1 filled bread to skillet. Sauté until filling is heated through and bread is golden, about 5 minutes per side. Place on sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining pitas. Cut into wedges.
