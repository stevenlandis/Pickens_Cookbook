Wives of Military Assistance Advisory Group, Taipei, Formosa 1954

	1 whole fish, about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds (or fillet)
	6 scallions
	3 slices ginger
	3 tablespoons vinegar
	1 to 2 teaspoons sugar
	6 tablespoons sugar
	1 tablespoon cornstarch
	1 tablespoon soy sauce
	1 teaspoon salt
	3/4 cup water or chicken stock
	oil for deep frying

Clean the fish and cut 3 or 4 lines on each side about 1/4 inch deep.  Cut at an angle.  Dry fish and brush all over lightly with cornstarch.  Heat 1/2 to 1 cup oil in wok to hot.  Carefully add the fish to fry.  Move the fish around in the wok to cook from head to tail.  When brown on one side, turn the fish over and cook the other side.  The fish is done when the meat flakes.  The fish will cook quickly, so watch it closely when it begins to brown.  Remove the fish to a paper towel to drain.  Keep it warm.

Mix the vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and diluted cornstarch with 3/4 cup water or chicken stock.  Stir and set aside.

Chop up the onion in 1 inch pieces, cutting at an angle.  Mince the ginger.  Heat a pan, add 1 or 2 teaspoons oil, and when hot, add the onion and ginger.  Stir fry a few seconds then pour in the vinegar mixture.  Stir constantly until the sauce thickens.  Keep hot.  Transfer the fish to a platter and pour the sweet and sour sauce over the fish and serve.
