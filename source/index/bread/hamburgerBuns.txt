A World of Breads, Dolores Casella

	2 cups water
	1/2 cup oil (not butter)
	1/4 cup sugar
	1 tablespoon salt
	1/3 cup warm water
	2 cakes yeast
	2 large eggs
	6 cups flour

Heat the 2 cups water to boiling.  Pour over the oil, sugar, and salt.  Cool until only lukewarm.  Dissolve the yeast in 1/3 cup warm water.  Add to cooled mixture along with the eggs and half the flour.  Stir until smooth.  Add the rest of the flour and blend in.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead lightly.  Shape into rolls and place on buttered cookie sheet.  Let rise until doubled.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven until golden brown--15 to 20 minutes.

This dough tends to be somewhat sticky.  Additional flour may be needed for kneading.  Keep hands well floured when shaping into rolls.  Remember, the more flour used, the heavier the rolls.
