Cinnamon/Sugar Goodies

@body
This is a great way to use leftover pie dough.  It's also a good "first" baking experience for children.  Your Dad and I agree on our first attempts.  We worked the dough so much that the goodies were tough, but we ate them anyway.

	Extra pie dough
	cinnamon
	sugar

Roll pie dough out the same thickness as for making a pie crust.  Lay it on an ungreased pie tin or cookie sheet, depending on the amount of dough.  Dust the surface with sugar and cinnamon to taste.  You can also mix the sugar and cinnamon ahead of time.  Cut the dough into squares or diamonds.  A pizza cutter works well.

Bake in a preheated 450ยบ oven about 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove to a cooling rack and watch them evaporate.  If any are left, put them on a plate and leave the plate on the table.
