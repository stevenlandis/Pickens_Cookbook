Ann Berardocco

	6-8 broccoli crowns.
	3 TBS chopped onions or onion powder to taste
	2 quarts milk
	6 TBS chicken bouillon
	6 TBS butter
	5-6 TBS flour
	2 cups grated cheddar cheese
	1 pint cream

Wash broccoli.  Cut the tops into flowerets small enough to fit in a soup spoon.  Peel the stems, trim and cut up into an inch dice.  Microwave the stems with a few tablespoons water and onion powder or diced onions until tender.  Remove and repeat with flowerets.  Drain flowerets and immerse in ice water.  Purée the stems and onions in a food processor or blender.

Heat milk in a soup pot.  Simmer with chicken boullion.

In a separate pan, melt the butter, add the flour and cook for a few minutes.  Whisk in a cup of the hot milk and stir the roux until thickened.  Add the roux mixture to the soup pot and mix until thick.  

Stir in puréed stems.  Add flowerets.  Stir in cheddar cheese until melted.  Before serving, add pint of cream.  Heat and season to taste.
