	1 1/2 pounds ground beef
	3/4 pound bacon, or less, cut in small pieces
	1/2 cup onions, chopped
	2 small cans or 1 large can of pork and beans
	1 can (16 ounces) red kidney beans, drained
	1 can (16 ounces) green lima beans, drained
	1 cup catsup
	1/4 cup brown sugar
	3 tablespoons vinegar
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon pepper, or to taste
	
Brown the bacon and beef.  Pour off excess grease.  Add onions to meat and brown.  Add seasoning and stir.  Add beans last.  Do not stir too much or beans will get mushy.  Simmer to heat through and blend flavors.â€š
