Preheat oven to 375ยบ.
Split a piece while it's hot, and top with homemade jam or maple syrup.  We like it plain, too, with Texas Red chili.
 
	3/4 cup butter, margarine, or shortening
	3/4 cup sugar
	3 large eggs
	1 1/2 cups coarsely ground cornmeal
	2 cups flour
	3 teaspoons baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 cups milk
 
Cream butter and sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs and beat until blended.  Stir in the cornmeal.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir the sifted dry ingredients into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.  Turn into a buttered 9", 10", or 12" cake pan.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the cornbread is browned and tests done with a toothpick.
