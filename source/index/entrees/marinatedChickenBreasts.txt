Marinated Chicken Breast

We first tasted this dish at Paula's and thought it was excellent, thanks to Marsha and John's friendship with Paula and Joe.  We like them, too, as well as the chicken.

	6 chicken breasts, skinned and boned
	1/2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
	1/3 cup olive oil
	1/4 cup cider vinegar
	3 cloves garlic, crushed
	3 tablespoons coarse-grain prepared mustard
	1-1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
	1-1/2 tablespoon lime juice
	1-1/2  teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon pepper (fresh ground)

Place the chicken breasts in a large shallow dish.

Combine the ingredients in the marinade, stir well, and pour over the chicken breasts.  Cover and refrigerate for two hours or longer.

Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade and grill for about 8 minutes on each side.  Watch carefully so the chicken does not blacken or burn, just golden brown.  Baste the chicken with the marinade while it is cooking if needed.  Discard the unused marinade.

I frequently use a plastic bag rather than a pan to marinate.  Put the chicken in the bag, pour in the marinade, squeeze out the air gently, and secure the opening tightly with a twist.  Move the chicken around in the closed bag to insure all the pieces are covered with the marinade and refrigerate as directed.  For safety purposes, put the marinade bag in a dish to catch any leakage.
