Cranberry Salad

Edith Steiner

This salad was a "tradition" in the Steiner household when I was growing up.  It makes a sizable amount, which is good because it keeps well.  Some people I know like it for breakfast. 

	1 quart cranberries
	1 pound sugar (2 1/4 cups)

Grind the cranberries, add the sugar and let the mixture stand covered overnight.

	1 cup marshmallows (small size and optional)
	1 cup celery, cut in small pieces
	1 cup walnuts, chopped
	1 pint cream, whipped
	1 package strawberry or cherry Jell-O

Prepare the Jell-O as instructed on the package.  Chill.  When the Jell-O is almost set, whip it thoroughly.  Keep chilled.

Whip the cream until soft peaks are formed.  Fold the whipped cream into the whipped Jell-O.  DO NOT fold the Jell-O into the cream.

Gently fold the rest of the ingredients into the blended Jell-O and cream.  The salad keeps well, covered, in the refrigerator.
