Lasagne

Preheat oven to 375ยบ.

This came from a magazine years ago, but it has endless variations, and all of them taste good.

Meat sauce:
	1 pound bulk sausage, Italian type preferred
	1 tablespoon parsley, chopped
	1 tablespoon basil, chopped
	1 1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 cups tomatoes
	2 6 ounce cans of tomato paste (1 1/3 cups)

Brown the sausage in a skillet.  Pour off excess grease.  Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 1 hour over low heat.

Cheese Sauce:
	3 cups ricotta
	2 eggs
	2 teaspoons salt
	1/2 teaspoon pepper
	2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
	1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated

In a bowl, add and mix all the cheese sauce ingredients well.  Set aside.

Noodles:
Cook 10 ounces lasagna noodles as directed to al dente only.  

1 pound Mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced

In a 9 x 13 inch or other lasagna pan, layer the bottom with a big spoonful of the meat sauce.  Layer the noodles next covering the total area of the pan.  By the spoonful, daub the cheese sauce on top of the noodles.  Remember, the meat sauce and the cheese sauce will spread while the lasagna bakes.

Repeat the layering using all the meat, cheese, and noodles.  Broken noodles should be used in the middle layers.  End the layers with the meat sauce.  Cover the surface with 1 pound mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced.  Bake in a 375ยบ oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand to firm up for at least 15 minutes.

Make this meatless if you prefer.  You can fold steamed, chopped, well-drained spinach into the cheese, too, or add it to the tomato gravy with or without meat.
