Use mixer for fluffy and light frosting.  Mix with a spoon for a dark and satiny frosting.

	2 1/2 1 ounce squares unsweetened chocolate
	2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
	3 tablespoons hot water
	1 egg
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1/3 cup soft butter or margarine

Melt chocolate in the mixing bowl over hot water.  Remove from heat.  Add and blend in sugar and water with electric mixer.  Beat in the egg, then the butter and vanilla.

Place mixing bowl in a larger bowl of ice water and beat the icing mixture until it becomes a spreading consistency.

This icing will cover the tops and sides of 2, 9-inch layer cakes.
