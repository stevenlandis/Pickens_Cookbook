Ina was unhappy her friend Lily, from Voice of America, included this recipe in a Polish cookbook.  Ina insisted it was her mother's recipe and she had given it to Lily.  No matter who is the original source, this is delicious served as an aperitif or an accompaniment to a Polish or Russian menu.

Our chemist friends recommend buying the most inexpensive vodka which has no other additives or flavor enhancers.

	1 quart vodka
	1 lemon
	2 teaspoons sugar

Carefully peel 1 lemon and retain only the yellow skin.  Add the lemon peel and 2 teaspoons of sugar to the vodka.  Cover, shake well, and let rest for four days.

Strain the vodka.  Discard the lemon peel and return the vodka to the bottle.  Chill well in refrigerator or freezer.  Serve in "thimbles" or small liqueur glasses.  Nastrovia!
